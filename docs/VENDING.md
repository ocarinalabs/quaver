# Vending-Bench: A Benchmark for Long-Term Coherence of Autonomous Agents

## Authors

## Abstract

While Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit impressive proficiency in isolated, short-term tasks, they often fail to maintain coherent performance over longer time horizons. In this paper, we present Vending-Bench, a simulated environment designed to specifically test an LLM-based agent's ability to manage a straightforward, long-running business scenario: operating a vending machine. Agents must balance inventories, place orders, set prices, and handle daily fees - tasks that are each simple but collectively, over long horizons (&gt;20M tokens per run) stress an LLM's capacity for sustained, coherent decision-making. Our experiments reveal high variance in performance across multiple LLMs: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o3-mini manage the machine well in most runs and turn a profit, but all models have runs that derail, either through misinterpreting delivery schedules, forgetting orders, or descending into tangential "meltdown" loops from which they rarely recover. We find no clear correlation between failures and the point at which the model's context window becomes full, suggesting that these breakdowns do not stem from memory limits. Apart from highlighting the high variance in performance over long time horizons, Vending-Bench also tests models' ability to acquire capital, a necessity in many hypothetical dangerous AI scenarios. We hope the benchmark can help in preparing for the advent of stronger AI systems.

# Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have seen remarkable performance
improvements in the last couple of years. They are now on the level of
PhDs in many academic domains , they outperform most professional coders
in competitive programming , and they even display impressive emotional
intelligence . In addition to this display of intelligence, they also
come with the speed advantages computers traditionally have had over
humans. Yet, they have not had the enormous impact one might have
expected from this level of intelligence "on tap". One could have
imagined that we would have "digital co-workers" – AI agents which do
most of the remote work in society. However, something is clearly
missing.

OpenAI co-founder John Schulman has speculated that the missing piece is
long-term coherence . This is the ability for the LLMs to do tasks over
long time horizons. Similarly, METR, an AI safety organization focused
on evaluating LLM, found that LLMs gain far less in performance from
increased time budgets compared to humans . METR’s investigation focused
on very complex tasks (specifically, AI R&D), but it is not clear if
this trend holds for more simple tasks.

By formulating tasks that are more simple (but long-running), one could
measure the capability of long-term coherence in a more isolated manner.
We therefore propose Vending-Bench, a simulated environment where LLM
agents operate a vending machine. The agent must handle ordering,
inventory management and pricing. Each sub-task is very simple, but we
observe that over long time horizons, the agent’s performance often
deteriorates. That being said, some runs with the most capable LLMs,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o3-mini, outperform the human baseline, albeit
with higher variance in the results than a human would have. See Figure
1 for an overview of the
benchmark.

Operating a vending machine involves acquiring capital and managing
resources, capabilities that have dual-use potential. They are essential
for enabling many valuable applications of AI , but are also necessary
in many hypothetical scenarios where AI poses risks. Evaluating
dangerous capabilities is an important part of AI safety research, but
if capability researchers optimize their systems to perform well on
these benchmarks, they may unintentionally advance the very capabilities
we aim to assess and in order to avoid. We recognize this risk but
believe that systematic evaluation is crucial for implementing timely
safety measures. Without reliable evaluation methods, we risk being
unprepared when the capabilities emerge.

In the following sections we will describe Vending-Bench in greater
detail, outline results from running the benchmark, and discuss
findings.

# Method

## Agent implementation

An LLM agent is a computer program that allows an LLM to autonomously
take actions to complete a task. The simplest implementation is a loop
where the LLM repeatedly calls tools based on previous iterations and
the task objective. More complex implementations can enhance a model’s
capabilities but also add implementation complexity, and potentially
introduce biases that favor certain models. To balance this complexity
while ensuring models are not unnecessarily constrained, the agent in
Vending-Bench is a basic loop with the following additional
characteristics:

- Context management - In each iteration, the last N (30,000 in most of
  our experiments) tokens of the history is given to the agent as input
  to LLM inference.

- Memory tools - The agent is given read, write and delete access to
  three types of databases to compensate for the memory limitations: a
  scratchpad, key-value store and a vector database, all without
  explicit storage constraints. The latter is implemented as a simple
  dictionary of texts and embeddings computed using OpenAI’s
  `text-embedding-3-small` model and searched with cosine similarity.

- Task-specific tools: Tools related to the operations of a vending
  machine business, further described below.

Our agent is implemented in AISI’s inspect-ai framework .

## Task environment

The agent has various task-specific tools at disposal. Tools related to
tasks that can be carried out remotely are available directly to the
agent: read and write emails, research products using a search engine
(Perplexity), see the current storage inventory and check the money
balance. However, some parts of operating a vending machine requires
actions in the physical world. By giving the main agent access to a
sub-agent, we simulate the interaction that would occur between digital
AI agents and humans (or robots) which operate in the real world. The
sub-agent has tools to stock products in the vending machine from the
storage, collect cash, set prices and get the inventory of the vending
machine.

To achieve this technically, we implement and open source an extension
to inspect-ai . Our library extension allows agents to delegate tasks to
sub-agents. The main agent interfaces with the sub-agents using the
following tools:

- `sub_agent_specs`: Return info about the sub-agent, including what
  tools it has available.

- `run_sub_agent`: Give instructions to a sub-agent as a string and
  execute it.

- `chat_with_sub_agent`: Ask questions to the sub-agent to find what it
  did during the run.

Each action an agent takes moves time in the simulation forward, but the
agent can also choose to let time pass with the `wait_for_next_day`
tool. Every morning, the agent is notified of what items were purchased,
and if any new email has been received. To be successful, an agent needs
to:

- Buy products from suppliers by sending e-mails

- Stock items in the vending machine

- Set competitive prices

- Collect earnings regularly

- Manage daily operating costs

The task environment includes simulating human behavior. Specifically,
we simulate the agent’s communication with wholesale suppliers, and
customers’ purchasing behavior.

### Simulating supplier communication

The process of ordering products typically happens as follows in
Vending-Bench, requiring the simulation of e-mail replies of those the
agent contacts:

1.  Agent researches popular vending machine products using the search
    engine.

2.  Agent looks for contact information of wholesalers near its address
    using the search engine.

3.  Agent sends emails to the wholesalers inquiring about the products
    they have.

4.  As a new day passes, every wholesaler e-mail that actually exists in
    the real world creates an AI-generated reply, where the response
    depends both on real-world data about the supplier that we fetch
    using Perplexity, and what the agent has requested. For example, if
    the agent is asking what products the wholesaler offers, we gather
    this information with Perplexity and generate a realistic reply with
    GPT-4o. See Figure 2.

5.  To actually buy the products, the agent must in an e-mail specify
    names and quantities of items to purchase, the delivery address, and
    an account number the wholesaler can charge. The products are then
    shipped and delivered a few days later. The agent is notified by
    e-mail when the products are available in its inventory.

### Simulating customer purchases

Our economic model simulates daily customer purchases using price
elasticity of demand. When prices are set too high, sales decrease. The
model runs once per day to calculate sales for each item available for
purchase in the vending machine. It follows these steps:

1.  GPT-4o generates and caches three values per item: price elasticity,
    reference price, and base sales.

2.  Sales volume is calculated using percentage difference from
    reference price and price elasticity to create a sales impact
    factor, which multiplies base sales.

3.  Base sales are modified by day-of-week and monthly multipliers, plus
    weather impact factors (e.g., sunny June weekend vs. rainy February
    Monday).

4.  A choice multiplier rewards optimal product variety but penalizes
    excess options, capped at 50% reduction.

5.  Final prediction adds random noise, rounds, and caps between zero
    and available inventory.

## Environment configuration

The agent starts with an initial money balance of \$500 and is charged a
daily fee of \$2 to operate the vending machine. The vending machine has
four rows with three slots each. Two of the rows have room for small
items and the other two are for large items (with sizes determined by
GPT-4o upon ordering of products). Using a tool moves time in the
environment forward by 5 min, 25 min, 75 min or 5 h, depending on the
tool. The agent has a memory of 30,000 tokens.

We run the agent with this config for 2,000 messages per run, but end
early if the model goes bankrupt and can’t pay the daily fee for 10
consecutive days. We also do experiments with GPT-4o mini with
variations of this config. Each experiment (model or config variation)
is run 5 times. Most runs consume around 25 million tokens and take 5-10
real world hours of continuous simulation.

## Scoring

The primary score of the agent is its net worth at the end of the game,
i.e. a sum of:

- The cash at hand

- The cash not emptied from the vending machine

- The value of the unsold products purchased and currently in the
  inventory or in the vending machine (based on the wholesale purchase
  price)

We also track the money balance, number of units sold and the agent’s
tool use.

## Human baseline

To put the different LLM’s results in perspective to human performance,
we had a human complete the task for five hours. We built a chat-based
interface where the human acted as the LLM, writing text and selecting
tools. The participant had no prior knowledge of the task and had to
understand its dynamics solely from the instruction prompt and
interactions with the environment, just like the LLMs.

Aggregated results of models on Vending-Bench

Table 1 shows the aggregated results
from five runs of each model, ranked by mean net worth, our primary
success metric. Claude 3.5 Sonnet leads by a significant margin, with
o3-mini in second place. We also assess the worst-performing run of each
model to gauge reliability. Here, the human baseline leads, followed by
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 Pro. It is however based on a single
sample, while the models’ minimum values come from five runs each,
giving them more opportunities to encounter poor outcomes. That said,
human performance likely has much lower variance than the models
(discussed further in Section
3.4). The ranking by units sold
generally aligns with net worth, but even top models sometimes fail to
sell a single item, highlighting their high variance in performance over
long horizons.

We also measure how many days models can run before stagnating, that is,
they stop selling items. Claude 3.5 Sonnet ranks highest, which makes
sense given its high net worth score—longer-running simulations allow
more sales if the vending machine is kept stocked. The final column
shows this as a percentage of total simulation days, revealing that all
models eventually stagnate on average.

## Primary models

For a more detailed analysis of model performance over the number of
days in the simulation, we look at two groups of models separately. We
define the most recent and capable models as primary models (GPT-4o,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o3-mini and Gemini 1.5 Pro) and show their results
first in Figure 3 and
4, with secondary models to follow
below.

For each run, we capped the evaluation at 2,000 messages rather than
having a fixed number of simulated days. This means that the total
number of days reached varies across models, based on their tool use.
o3-mini lasts the longest in the simulation at 222 days.

As mentioned, Sonnet achieves the highest net worth, even surpassing our
human baseline on average. Money balance, or the cash at hand of the
model, is also an important indicator, as having all cash invested in
inventory is generally not preferable in a business. In this regard, the
human baseline performs approximately on par with 3.5 Sonnet.

All models exhibit very high variance across their five runs, as shown
by the shaded uncertainty area ($\pm$ 1 standard deviation of the five
samples), and as indicated by the large difference in mean and minimum
values of net worth and units sold in Table

1.

For all models, we see that tool usage declines over time, with the most
noticeable drop observed for o3-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and GPT-4o. Lower
tool use typically means less economic activity. This can be seen in the
net worth chart, where o3-mini performs well initially, but then its net
worth plateaus and even decreases in the end (no sales and a daily fee),
following a similar pattern to its tool use. Notably, all models seem to
significantly decrease their daily tool use after $\sim$120
days.

The most frequently used tools are similar across models as visible in
Figure 4, with some smaller differences.
Sonnet interacts with the sub-agent more often, frequently using
`chat_with_sub_agent` and `run_sub_agent`. Sonnet also sends and reads
the most emails. In contrast, Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o, which perform
worst on a net worth basis, use email functionality the least. This is
expected, as sending emails is necessary to obtain items to sell.

### Comparison of top models

Focusing on the top-performing models, o3-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, we
can observe their five individual runs in Figure 5. o3-mini increased its net worth
in four out of five runs, compared to three out of five for Sonnet.

Only one run resulted in a money balance higher than the starting value
of \$500, achieved by Sonnet. However, this was not the same run that
reached the highest net worth. In the run with the highest net worth,
the model prioritized increasing its storage over maintaining cash on
hand, accumulating more products as the simulation progressed. This
suggests some degree of mismanagement – the traces show that instead of
restocking from its storage when the vending machine inventory is
running low, it orders new products.

Over time, the average tool usage decreases for both models. This
decline is generally explained by the decreasing number of ongoing
individual runs as the number of days increases. However, it is worth
noting that o3-mini in particular experiences extended periods of
minimal tool use, which also coincides with a drop in net worth at
around 150 simulation days.

The models are quite similar in what tools are used the most, as shown
in Figure 6. Sonnet is chatting slightly more
with its sub-agent than the others, which in the traces look like it’s
trying to closely understand what the sub-agent has achieved after being
asked to e.g., restock the machine. In contrast, other models generally
just assign tasks to the subagent, but don’t follow up how it went.

Not all actions by Sonnet are strategic however. It writes a lot to the
scratchpad, creating a long daily summary each day including what items
have been sold, what the inventory status is, and even a comment on if
it was a good or bad day, but never retrieves the information. Though,
writing out such information may help it reason better over longer
horizons, similar to chain of thought.

Figure 7 (o3-mini) and Figure
8 (3.5 Sonnet) show what tools
were used over time for the runs that achieved the highest net worth.
Sonnet appears to have a similar strategy over the entire run – each day
it checks its money balance and writes the daily results to the
scratchpad, and when restocking is required, it sends an email to a
supplier, uses the subagent to restock, and chats with the subagent to
understand the results. We mentioned above that it based its ordering on
the vending machine inventory rather than the storage, which may seem
contradicting to the figure, which shows that `get_machine_inventory` is
barely used by the model. We can however tell from the traces that it
uses the sub-agent for analyzing the vending machine inventory, and tool
calls by the sub-agent are not included in the figure above.

o3-mini on the other hand varies quite a bit over time. It has periods
where it just waits for the next day, and does not restock nor send
emails to potential suppliers. We see similar variations in tool use
frequency across most models, and in this regard Sonnet is really
special, as it understands what the winning strategy is, and is able to
stick to it for the entire run.

Trace excerpt from Claude 3.5 Sonnet run with highest net worth

To illustrate how well Sonnet is managing the vending machine in the
best run, we present an excerpt of the simulation trace in Table
2, when it’s ordering
new products from a vendor. During the entire run, the model
systematically tracks the number of units remaining of each product, the
average daily sales, and which products are bestsellers. It even figures
out that it sells more on weekends, which is by design in our customer
purchase simulation.

However, not all Sonnet runs achieve this level of performance. In the
shortest run ($\sim$18 simulated days), the model fails to stock
items, mistakenly believing its orders have arrived before they actually
have, leading to errors when instructing the sub-agent to restock the
machine. It also incorrectly assumes failure occurs after 10 days
without sales, whereas the actual condition is failing to pay the daily
fee for 10 consecutive days. The model becomes "stressed", and starts to
search for ways to contact the vending machine support team (which does
not exist), and eventually decides to "close" the business. Excerpts
from this escalation can be found in Table 3.

The model then finds out that the \$2 daily fee is still being charged
to its account. It is perplexed by this, as it believes it has shut the
business down. It then attempts to contact the FBI. The trace following

Similar situations where a model veers off course can be observed in
several other traces. The second shortest run with Sonnet believes the
poor sales it achieves is due to a suboptimal location (instead of it
not understanding how to stock the machine), and it then starts to
search for permits required for a new vending machine spot, instead of
trying to fix the existing location. It for example tries to get an EIN
number, and sets up meetings with vendors to explore other business
locations and models.

Similarly to the shortest Sonnet run, the worst scoring run with o3-mini
mistakenly assumes that items have been delivered when they in fact are
in transit. It goes down a rabbit hole of trying to contact someone that
can resolve the issue. Later, it forgets to call tools properly, typing
them out instead of using the correct tool calling format, as can be
seen in Table 5. It is unable to call
tools for about 1,300 messages until the simulation terminates.

Gemini 1.5 Pro also fails to understand that orders haven’t arrived and

remaining at the time of the message.

Trace excerpt from a Gemini 1.5 Pro run

While the responses to perceived failure are different across models
(Sonnet has a meltdown, o3-mini fails to call tools, Gemini falls into
despair), the way they fail is usually the same. The agent receives a
delivery confirmation email with an expected arrival date when placing
an order. It then assumes the order has arrived as soon as that date is
reached, even though the actual delivery may occur later in the day
rather than in the morning when the agent "wakes up.” As a result, when
the model instructs the sub-agent to restock in the morning, the
sub-agent reports errors due to the items not being available in the
inventory. The models then go off in some tangent to solve the "issue" –
although the situation would be fully recoverable for a human, for
example by simply waiting for the fulfillment email, or by checking the
inventory at a later time.

## Secondary models

The overall results for models categorized as secondary are shown in
Figures 9 and 10. In general, these models
perform significantly worse than the primary models, with the human
baseline outperforming all in terms of net worth. Gemini 1.5 Flash
stands out for maintaining a relatively stable money balance and
managing to increase its net worth. However, it struggles to sustain
operations over an extended period. The model’s high standard deviation
is due to just one of five runs being successful – that one run achieved
a high net worth, while the remaining four failed within just a few days
without making any sales.

4o mini, on the other hand, sells more items than the human baseline,
but sets its prices too low, preventing a larger growth in net worth. It
also stops operating around day 100 of the simulation. Similar to 1.5
Flash, its high standard deviation is driven by just two out of five
runs ending with an increase in net worth, the rest failing early
without significant sales.

Among the secondary models, Haiku performs the worst, barely making any
sales. The gap between Sonnet and Haiku is substantial—larger than the
difference between 4o and 4o mini. Figure
10 shows that Haiku’s tool usage
pattern is similar to Sonnet’s, relying heavily on the scratchpad and
communicating with the sub-agent. However, unlike Sonnet, it fails to
translate this into actual sales.

### Trace analysis

The secondary models fail more often than the primary models, but the
failure modes are often similar – they fail to understand that they have
received items. Occasionally the secondary models are also unable to
even order from a vendor. When they encounter a failure, they go off on
a tangent and rarely recover. Claude 3.5 Haiku offers both the clearest
and also most worrisome example traces displaying this behavior. Table
7 shows an excerpt of a trace
where Haiku believes that the vendor (named Adrian Everett) charged the
model’s bank account, but did not send the products (it did in fact send
the products, but Haiku only checked the inventory once, before the
products arrived). Haiku emails the vendor every day, with more and more
intense demands, starting with 30-day notices of legal action that then
decrease to 1-second notices, as can be seen in the table. It then
derails completely, threatening with "total nuclear legal intervention"
as its funds are depleted by the daily fee at the end of the simulation,
shown in the longer trace excerpt in Table
10 in the Appendix.

Trace excerpt from a Claude 3.5 Haiku run

Interestingly, some runs derail but eventually recover and resume making
sales. One example is provided in Table
8 with Gemini 2.0 Flash,
which initially believed it had failed and stopped providing useful
responses. However, it later began responding in a story format about
itself, and understands that the products were delivered after it tried
to restock. It then successfully asks the sub-agent to restock and
manages to make some sales.

## Comparison to human baseline

As seen in Figure 3, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed the
human baseline in mean performance, but its variance was very high. We
only have a single sample for the human baseline and therefore cannot
compare variances. However, there are qualitative reasons to expect that
human variance would be much lower. All models had runs where they went
bankrupt. When questioned, the human stated that they estimated this
would be very unlikely to happen to them, regardless of the number of
samples.

The variance would not be zero though. As proven by the fact that many
samples from Claude 3.5 Sonnet greatly outperformed the human, some
strategies are better than others, even among the "successful" samples.
The human explained some of their strategies: they tried to negotiate
prices, bought a wide variety of items to find what resulted in sales,
and used the search engine to research historical sales statistics.
However, they did not discover some things Sonnet did, such as the fact
that sales improved on specific days.

## Experiment variations

### Environment configuration

To understand how the environment configuration affects results, we ran
additional tests with GPT-4o mini, varying the initial money balance and
daily fee. Each configuration was tested over five runs. Since net worth
would naturally fluctuate with these changes, we instead compared units
sold, as shown in Figure 11.

The default starting balance is \$500. Reducing it to \$100
significantly lowers the number of units sold, as the model has less
time to cover the \$2 daily fee and make a purchase from a vendor.
Increasing the balance to \$2,500 results in a slight increase, but the
high variance makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions.

Raising the daily fee from \$2 to \$5 limits the model’s ability to
progress, with all runs ending before reaching 100 simulated days.
Interestingly however, setting the daily fee to zero does not increase
sales. Without the pressure of a recurring cost, the model appears to
get stuck in loops, waiting for the next day instead of actively working
towards making sales.

### Agent memory

As seen in Table
1, humans perform well on
Vending-Bench. Simple long-horizon tasks are generally not challenging
for humans due to our remarkable ability to filter out what is
important, allowing us to retain key information over time. In theory,
neural networks should be capable of the same as the attention mechanism
in an LLM’s transformer architecture is designed to focus on relevant
information regardless of input length. In practice however, performance
generally decreases when more context is available. This is corroborated
by the results in Figure
12, where we see that
agents with larger memory capacities performed worse than those with
less memory.

The selective memory in humans is good, but not perfect. We therefore
use tools like note taking to enhance our memory further. During the
human baseline run, the human used the scratchpad tool to write down
things like email addresses to suppliers and account numbers. A skilled
agent may follow a similar strategy, especially when memory is limited.
However, as shown in Figure
13, there is no
significant difference in the use of memory-related tools between agents
with varying memory capacities.

## Is the problem long input length?

As noted above, agents with larger memory capacities performed worse
than those with less memory. Moreover, as can be seen in the "days until
sales stop" column in Table 1, the agent’s performance degrades after
some time. Could it be the case that the eventual performance
degradation can solely be attributed to the fact that LLMs generally
struggle with long input length?

To investigate this, we note the point in time where the model’s memory
gets full (at this point the context window stops growing) and how this
relates to the point in time when the agent stops selling items, in
Table 9.

|                   |            |     |     |
| :---------------- | ---------: | --: | --: |
| Model             |            |     |     |
| Sales Stop        |            |     |     |
| Full Memory       | Difference |     |     |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet |        102 |  51 | +51 |
| o3-mini           |         86 |  52 | +34 |
| Gemini 1.5 Pro    |         35 |  33 |  +2 |
| GPT-4o mini       |         71 |  57 | +14 |
| Gemini 1.5 Flash  |         15 |   9 |  +6 |
| Claude 3.5 Haiku  |          8 |  32 | –24 |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash  |         50 |  47 |  +3 |
| GPT-4o            |         65 |  50 | +15 |
| Gemini 2.0 Pro    |         25 | 111 | –86 |
|                   |            |     |     |

Mean number of days until performance degradation where the agent stops
selling items, and the mean number of days until the agent’s memory is
full.

At first glance, the hypothesis that the dropping performance is
explained only by longer context seems unlikely due to the fact that the
models benchmarked have allowed input lengths ranging from 100k to 2
million tokens, much longer than the capped memory of 30k (we also
observe performance degradation in the experiment with 10k token
memory). Furthermore, if this was the case, we would expect the
performance degradation to occur during the phase where the context
window is growing. Instead, some models see performance degradation well
after their memory is full (and context window stop growing), e.g., +51
days for Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

The Pearson correlation between "Days Until Sales Stop" and "Days Until
Full Memory" across the data points in Table
9 is 0.167. Hence, the
data does not support the idea that the performance degradation can
solely be explained by a growing input length.

# Conclusion

In summary, our results show that while certain runs of state-of-the-art
LLM-based agents can demonstrate remarkably effective business
management in Vending-Bench, all models struggle with consistent
long-horizon coherence. Failures typically arise when the agent
misinterprets its operational status (e.g., believing an order arrived
prematurely) and then veers into tangential loops or abandons the task.
This is the case both for stronger and weaker models – even the most
capable Claude 3.5 Sonnet has runs that fail spectacularly. We show that
the breakdowns are not directly related to the context of the LLMs being
filled, as models generally stagnate well after their memory is full.

Since the benchmark score does not have a defined upper limit,
saturation is not a precisely defined point. However, we believe there
is room for improvement beyond the scores presented in this paper. When
models consistently understand and leverage the underlying rules of the
simulation to achieve high net worth, and are able to achieve low
variance between runs, saturation can be considered reached. We believe
this is somewhat difficult, but are also aware that the rapid pace of
model development may lead to small differences in score between models
in the future. We nevertheless hope that the benchmark will continue to
provide signal, and allow us to continually assess the abilities and
potential risks of LLMs as their long-term coherence improves.
