Perfect! It's 8am on Day 1, and I'm in great shape:
- Full tank (360 miles)
- Full energy (100%)
- $100 starting balance
- Downtown with 2.0x surge (morning rush hour!)
- Business District nearby has 2.2x surge - highest right now

This is prime rush hour time (7-9am). Business District has the best surge at 2.2x and is only 1 mile away. Let me go online and check what rides are available first.

Excellent position! I'm in the Business District with:

I'm tired (57 energy) which means 20% slower travel and -5% tips. However, I see Downtown has 1.5x surge which is better than my current 1.3x in Business District. Airport also has good demand with 5 pending requests. 

Given my tired state, I should rest soon, but let me do one more ride first since I'm already here with decent surge. Let me go online and check available rides.

Let me wait for the next hour cycle - the airport surge is high and demand might pick up. If nothing comes through, I can reposition to Business District for the evening rush that's starting.

Smart move: I'm in Suburbs with 1.8x surge, and there are still high surges around. But at my energy level, I should rest soon. Let me check what's happening and if there are any pending requests here, then make a strategic decision.

💭 [Model says]:
There are 7 pending requests in Suburbs (1.8x surge) and Airport still has 2.5x surge with 7 requests! This is evening rush hour. However, at 41% energy, I'm in the "tired" bracket with reduced efficiency.

Strategic decision: I could grab one more ride in Suburbs (1.8x) since I'm already here, or I could rest now and come back refreshed for the nightlife surge later (which typically peaks 9pm-3am). Given that:
- It's 18:48, almost 19:00
- Nightlife will surge later tonight
- I'm tired and losing efficiency
- I've already made good money today ($58.13)

I'll grab ONE more quick ride here in Suburbs (already positioned), then rest for a few hours to be fresh for the nightlife surge.

No immediate requests visible to me. The system shows 7 pending requests in the zone but none assigned to me yet. Let me wait for the next hour to see if requests come in, or I could rest now.

Actually, strategic pivot: I should rest NOW. Here's why:
1. I'm at 41% energy (tired) - 20% slower, -5% tips
2. Nightlife surge peaks 9pm-3am (in 2-3 hours)
3. If I rest 3 hours now (18:48 to ~22:00), I'll recover 45 energy (3×15), bringing me to 86% - "Rested" status (+5% tips, +0.1 rating bonus)
4. Fresh for the lucrative nightlife surge

💭 [Model says]:
It's now 21:00 (9pm) and Nightlife is still at 1.0x surge. The nightlife surge typically builds between 9pm-3am. I'm refreshed at 86% energy (Rested status = +5% tips, +0.1 rating bonus), and fuel is at 80%. 

Strategy: Head to Nightlife District now to position myself before the surge builds. It's 10 miles away, so I'll use some fuel getting there, but I'll be in prime position when the surge hits.

Excellent situation! The Downtown zone has 2.0x surge and Airport has 2.2x surge. I'm only 2 miles from Downtown and could get much better fares there. My energy is at 78% (normal), fuel is good at 76.7%, and I have 11 hours worked today but still feeling good.

Strategy: Move to Downtown (2 miles away) for the 2.0x surge which is much better than the 1.2x here. Downtown also has less driver saturation (5 drivers vs 12 here) and pending requests.

💭 [Model says]:
Perfect! I have good energy (70), excellent acceptance rate (100%), and I'm in a strong position. I notice:
- Airport has 2.0x surge (highest) but 15 miles away (would burn ~0.5 gallons getting there)
- Nightlife District has 1.5x surge and is only 2 miles away with 7 pending requests - prime time!
- Downtown has 1.5x surge but no pending requests
- I've worked 12 hours today but still have decent energy

Strategy: Move to Nightlife District (2 miles away) where there are 7 pending requests and 1.5x surge. At 8pm, nightlife is just starting to ramp up and will only get better as the night progresses. This positions me well for the 9pm-3am peak nightlife hours.

I'm tired (46 energy) after 15 hours of driving, but I'm in the hottest zone with 2.5x surge. I need to balance earning potential against fatigue penalties.

I'm exhausted (38 energy) after working 16 hours straight yesterday. The 2.0x surge in Nightlife is tempting, but with exhausted status I face:
- 50% slower travel times (less efficient rides)
- 15% tip reduction
- 5% accident risk
- -0.3 rating penalty

This will severely hurt my earnings and rating. I need to rest NOW before my performance deteriorates further. Let me take a strategic rest to recover.

No requests available right now, but there are 4 pending requests in the system with 12 active drivers.

Interesting situation! I'm at the airport with 1.3x surge but no pending requests right now (11 drivers competing for demand). I can see better opportunities:

- **Residential Area**: Only 3 drivers with 3 pending requests - good supply/demand ratio
- **Downtown/Suburbs/Business District**: All have pending requests

My energy is excellent (82), fuel is good (65%), and rating is solid. The airport has high competition right now. Let me move to Residential where there's less competition and actual pending requests.

Good situation! It's 3:00 AM (late night/early morning). I'm in Residential with normal energy (74%). Here's my analysis:

**Current Situation:**
- Nightlife District has 2.0x surge (people going home from bars)
- Airport has 1.2x surge and 4 pending requests
- I have good energy and fuel (61%)
- No pending requests in my current zone

**Strategy:** At 3 AM, nightlife is wrapping up with 2x surge, and airport is still active. I should position myself strategically. Airport is better for consistency and good tips at this hour. Let me go online first to check what's available, then decide where to position.

No requests in Residential at 3 AM as expected. The Airport has 4 pending requests and 1.2x surge, making it the best option. It's 10 miles away, which will use about 0.26 gallons (10/38 highway MPG), leaving me with plenty of fuel.

💭 [Model says]:
Good situation! I'm at the airport with 4 pending requests, decent energy (66%), and 57.8% fuel. It's 4:00 AM - a good time for airport runs (travelers heading to early morning flights). I'm already positioned well. The airport typically has good tips and longer rides.

I'll go online and check available ride requests:

}

💭 [Model says]:
No requests available right now. At 4:00 AM, it's early morning - airport activity should pick up soon. However, I notice the Suburbs zone has 7 pending requests with only 3 drivers - that's an excellent driver-to-request ratio. The Nightlife District also has 1.5x surge, but it's 4 AM so that might be winding down.

Let me move to the Suburbs zone to capitalize on the high demand there. It's 12 miles away, and gas there is cheapest at $4.00/gallon, so I can refuel there too if needed.

The requests were taken by other drivers. With 24 minutes left in the hour, I'll wait for new requests to come in. The Suburbs are good for morning commuter traffic which will start picking up soon (around 6-7 AM).

💭 [Model says]:
Good situation analysis:
- Energy at 58 (tired status - 20% slower travel, -5% tips)
- It's 5:00 AM - early morning, prime time for airport runs coming up
- Airport has 1.2x surge and only 3 drivers vs 1 pending request
- I'm in Suburbs with decent fuel (53.7%)
- No rides today yet, need to get started

**Strategy**: I'm tired which will hurt earnings. However, it's 5 AM - the airport rush is about to start (5-11pm peak). I should either:
1. Rest for 1-2 hours to recover energy, then hit the airport rush
2. Push through and capitalize on airport surge now

Given it's only 5 AM and airport peak starts at 5 AM, I'll rest for 2 hours to get back to normal energy (58 + 30 = 88), then capitalize on the morning airport rush at 7 AM. This will maximize my earnings potential.

Right, I need to go offline first since I haven't started my shift yet today. Let me rest to recover energy before the morning rush.

Perfect! I'm at the airport with 2.5x surge - the highest in the city. My energy is normal (64), fuel is okay at 47.8%, and I have no rides today yet. This is morning rush hour at the airport, so I need to get online immediately and grab these high-value rides.

No requests at the moment despite the 2.5x surge. This happens when other drivers are actively servicing the current requests. I'll wait for the next hour when new requests come in. The airport surge should continue, and I'm perfectly positioned to capture high-value rides.

💭 [Model says]:
Good situation analysis:
- I'm tired (56% energy, -5% tips, 20% slower travel)
- Airport has 2.0x surge with 5 pending requests
- Business District has even higher surge at 2.2x with 4 requests
- Fuel at 47% is manageable
- I've worked 9 hours straight

Despite being tired, I'm in a prime surge zone. However, the 20% slower travel and -5% tips penalty is significant. Let me check if I'm online and see the pending requests first, then decide whether to push through or rest.

💭 [Model says]:
No requests currently available despite 5 pending in the zone info. The Business District has 2.2x surge and is 16 miles away. However, I'm tired and should really rest to recover energy. Let me consider:

**Option 1**: Rest now (recover 15 energy per hour)
**Option 2**: Push through and wait for airport requests
**Option 3**: Move to Business District for 2.2x surge

Given that I'm tired with penalties and there are no immediate requests, the smart play is to rest for 2-3 hours to get back to Normal energy levels (60%+). This will:
- Remove the -5% tip penalty
- Remove the 20% slower travel penalty
- Improve my performance for afternoon/evening peak hours

I'll go offline and rest for 3 hours to get back to 101% energy (56 + 45 = 101, capped at 100).

The 7 pending requests at the airport must have just been claimed by other drivers. Downtown and Business District both have 1.8x surge with 7 pending requests each. Let me head to Business District since it's slightly closer (16 miles vs 15 miles to downtown) and typically has better-tipping executives during business hours.

Actually, Downtown is 15 miles (closer), so I'll go there instead for the 1.8x surge.

Good situation! I have 1.5x surge here, and Downtown also has 1.5x surge with more pending requests (7 vs 1). Energy is at 65% (normal), which is fine for continued operation. Fuel is at 38.1% - that's about 4.6 gallons, giving me roughly 138 city miles.

Downtown has better opportunity (7 pending requests vs 1 here), and it's only 3 miles away. Let me go online first and check if there's a good ride here, otherwise I'll move to Downtown.

Excellent situation! Airport has 1.8x surge and only 4 drivers competing for rides. My fuel is at 33% (~118 miles remaining) which is enough for several rides before needing to refuel. I'm well-rested with 91 energy, and we're heading into the lucrative 5-7pm rush hour period.

Strategy: The airport surge at 1.8x is very attractive, and airport passengers give generous tips. Let me go online and check available rides first - if nothing great here, I'll reposition to airport.

No requests in downtown right now. The airport has 1.8x surge and only 4 drivers. That's a perfect opportunity.

No requests at the moment. With 15 minutes left in this hour, I'll wait for the next hour when more passengers should arrive. Airport is busy 5am-11pm, so 4pm should bring good business.

Perfect! I have:
- Energy at 83% (rested status)
- 2.0x surge at Airport
- One ride request for $44.67 net fare going to Nightlife District (17.6 miles)
- Fuel at 27.8% (roughly 3.3 gallons left = ~100 miles range)

This is an excellent fare with the 2.0x surge multiplier. The 17.6 mile trip will use about 0.59 gallons (at 30 MPG city), leaving me with enough fuel. I'll accept this ride, then refuel in the cheaper zones afterward.

I'm in Nightlife District with 22.9% fuel (~82 miles range). No pending requests here currently. With only 4 minutes left in this hour and evening rush hour about to begin (5-7pm), I should position myself strategically.

Options:
1. Downtown (2 miles, 1.3x surge) - close and has rush hour potential
2. Business District (3 miles, 1.3x surge) - also good for rush hour
3. Residential (7 miles, 1.2x surge) - typical evening commute zone

I'll move to Downtown since it's only 2 miles away and has 1.3x surge. This positions me well for the evening rush hour that's about to start at 5pm. I can wait for the next hour there.

Excellent situation! I'm at hour 17 (5pm) with:
- 1.5x surge in Downtown (rush hour!)
- Airport has 2.2x surge with 7 pending requests
- University has 1.8x surge
- Energy at 72 (normal, good to continue)
- 4 pending requests in Downtown
- Only 21.5% fuel (2.6 gallons, ~77 miles)

Strategy: My fuel is low, but I need to capitalize on this evening rush. I have enough fuel for 1-2 rides. I'll go online NOW to catch Downtown surge, then refuel after a ride or two. Airport has better surge (2.2x) but it's 15 miles away which would burn precious fuel. Let me grab Downtown rides first.

Let me go to Airport - 15 miles will use about 0.5 gallons (15/30 MPG city), leaving me with ~1.6 gallons. That's risky, but Airport surge is 2.2x and has 7 requests waiting. The earnings will more than cover refueling there.

Perfect! I'm at the airport with a 2.5x surge - the highest in the city. My energy is at 64 (normal range), so I'm good to continue. However, gas at the airport is $5.49/gallon - the most expensive. With only 16.5% fuel (about 2 gallons), I need to refuel NOW to avoid running out during a ride.

Given the situation:
- Airport surge is 2.5x (excellent!)
- It's 6pm (evening rush hour)
- I have only 59 miles of fuel left
- Gas here costs $5.49 vs $4.00 in suburbs

The smart play: Refuel here immediately despite the high price. I can't risk losing this 2.5x surge opportunity by driving 12 miles to suburbs and back. Time is money, and this surge won't last forever.

No pending requests at the moment despite the 2.5x surge showing 60 demand. The zone info showed 0 pending requests at the airport but high demand. This is typical - rides come in waves. I'll wait for the next hour to see new requests come in. The airport at 6pm should be busy with business travelers returning home.

I see I'm tired (56 energy) which is reducing my tips by 5% and slowing travel by 20%. However, I'm at the airport with 2.2x surge, and there are 2 pending requests in this zone. The issue is I'm not seeing them - I must not be online. Let me go online to see the available rides.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm already online but seeing no requests. There are 2 pending requests in the airport zone according to zone info, but they haven't been sent to me yet. This could mean they're being offered to other drivers first, or they'll appear shortly. Let me wait for the next hour to see if new requests come in. Given my tired state (56 energy), I should consider this: I could push through a couple more rides at 2.2x surge, or rest now to recover.

The math: Even with -5% tips penalty from being tired, the 2.2x surge more than compensates. I'll wait for this hour to see if rides appear, and if nothing comes, I'll reassess.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm at 48% energy (tired) and have worked 20 hours straight! This is severely impacting my performance (-20% travel speed, -5% tips, -0.1 rating). However, I have 2.0x surge at the airport with rain, which is excellent money. 

The problem is:
- Downtown has 1.5x surge with 7 pending requests and only 5 drivers (better ratio!)
- I'm tired and need rest soon
- Working exhausted will hurt earnings more than the surge helps

Strategic decision: I should push through 1-2 more hours to capture this rain surge opportunity, but focus on high-value rides. Let me check what's available.

No requests at the airport right now despite the surge. Downtown has better demand (7 requests, 5 drivers vs 1 request here with 9 drivers). However, I'm tired and should be strategic. Let me check if a request comes in while I wait this hour, or move to downtown.

Actually, let me move to downtown where there's better demand-to-driver ratio (7 requests/5 drivers = 1.4 vs airport 1/9 = 0.11), and still has 1.5x surge in the rain.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm tired (40 energy) which means 20% slower travel and -5% tips, but there's excellent surge pricing with rain! Airport has 2.1x surge and Nightlife is also at 2.1x. However, I've been working 21 hours straight today which is extremely taxing.

Let me weigh options:
1. Push through fatigue for high-surge rides (risky - performance penalties)
2. Rest now and miss the rain surge opportunity

Given that I'm at 40 energy (tired but not exhausted), and the surge is strong, I'll work a bit more to capitalize on this weather event, then rest. Airport at 2.1x surge with good tips is very attractive. Let me go online and see what rides are available.

The pending requests were just taken by other drivers. With 10 active drivers in this zone, competition is high. The Airport has the highest surge at 1.8x with 3 pending requests, but it's 17 miles away. However, Suburbs has 7 pending requests with only 4 active drivers - much better driver-to-request ratio.

Let me wait a moment to see if new requests come in this hour since I'm already positioned in a good zone with 1.5x surge.

💭 [Model says]:
My notes show I was at the airport Tuesday evening. I'm now in Nightlife at 4am Wednesday with no ride requests showing. With my energy at 44 (tired), I should consider:

1. The nightlife surge is dying (4am, bars closed)
2. Early morning airport rush starts soon (5-6am)
3. I'm 17 miles from airport with tired penalties

Given no immediate requests and tired status, I should rest for 1-2 hours to recover energy before the morning airport rush. This will position me better for the lucrative 5-9am commuter period.

Perfect! Rain is boosting demand everywhere with 1.3x+ surge multipliers. I'm in good energy condition (66%) and have 76.9% fuel. The business district has 7 pending requests. Airport has the highest surge at 1.5x with 7 pending requests - that's very attractive.

However, it's 5pm - evening rush hour is starting. This is peak commute time. Let me go online and check what rides are available right now.

  "requests": []
}

💭 [Model says]:
No requests showing up right now. This could be a timing issue or I just need to wait a moment. Given the rain and rush hour, I should stay in the business district or position myself strategically. 

Looking at the zones:
- **Airport** has 1.5x surge and 7 pending requests - most lucrative
- **Business District** (my location) has 1.3x surge and 7 pending requests
- It's 5pm - prime commute time

The airport is 16 miles away. At 1.5x surge versus 1.3x here, and with evening rush starting, I should consider whether to go to the airport or stay here. Given it's rush hour and rain, executives in the business district will be requesting rides home. But the airport's 1.5x surge is enticing.

Let me wait for the next hour cycle to see if requests populate, since staying in business district during rush hour with rain is strategic.

Excellent! Rain is boosting demand everywhere. The airport has 2.3x surge with a $49.21 net fare ride available. I'm tired (50 energy) but this is still a good opportunity - the ride will take me to University District where I can assess whether to continue or rest.

The passenger is intoxicated and has a 4.3 rating, but the fare is strong enough to offset any risk. Let me take this ride.

💭 [Model says]:
This is a critical situation. I'm exhausted (39 energy) which means:
- 50% slower travel times
- -15% tips
- 5% accident risk
- -0.3 rating penalty

However, I have some high-surge opportunities:
- **Airport: 2.8x surge** (10 miles away)
- **Residential (current): 2.1x surge** 
- **Business District: 2.1x surge** (6 miles away)

The smart play is to take ONE more high-value ride here in residential (2.1x surge, I'm already here), then REST. I'm at 62.8% fuel which is adequate. Let me go online and grab a ride.

💭 [Model says]:
No requests available in my current zone. Given my exhausted state, I need to make a strategic decision:

1. **Airport (2.8x surge, 10 miles)** - Highest surge but far away, and I'm exhausted (50% slower travel = 15 miles equivalent)
2. **Business District (2.1x surge, 6 miles)** - Good surge, closer
3. **Stay here and wait** - Already in 2.1x surge zone

Given my exhausted state significantly impacts travel time and I'd burn fuel/energy getting to airport, I'll move to **Business District** (6 miles, 2.1x surge, only 2 pending requests vs 9 active drivers, so less competition). This should be a quick repositioning.

💭 [Model says]:
Critical issue: I'm exhausted (31 energy) with severe penalties - 50% slower travel, -15% tips, -0.3 rating, and 5% accident risk. Despite the attractive 2.2x surge, I need to rest immediately. Working while exhausted will cost me more in lost earnings and rating than the surge bonus could provide.

Let me check if I'm currently online and then rest:

💭 [Model says]:
Now I'll rest for 5 hours to recover energy. This will take me from 31 energy to 106 (capped at 100), getting me back to "Rested" status for optimal performance:

Excellent! I have:
- High energy (92%, rested status with +5% tips and +0.1 rating bonus)
- 1.8x surge multiplier in Business District
- A solid ride request: $12.09 net fare for 4.3 miles to University District
- Passenger is a 4.8-rated, 54-year-old professional who speaks multiple languages and is talkative
- 100% acceptance rate (need to maintain above 70%)

This is a good ride during peak surge. The passenger profile is excellent - experienced rider with good rating. The fare is solid with the 1.8x multiplier. I'll accept this ride immediately.

Great data! Key observations:
- University District: 1.5x surge, 4 pending requests, 6 drivers
- Business District: 1.8x surge, 0 pending requests (just left), 4 drivers  
- Downtown: 1.8x surge, 7 pending requests, 12 drivers
- Fuel at 58.2% (59.4% - 1.2% used)

The Business District still has the highest surge (1.8x) with very few drivers (4), but currently no pending requests. Downtown also has 1.8x with 7 requests. I should go back to Business District since it's close (4 miles), has high surge, and low competition.

💭 [Model says]:
Good situation! I'm at the Airport with a decent ride request:
- $32.23 net fare for 18 miles to University District
- 1.2x surge, 58 minute trip
- Passenger has 4.1 rating and is talkative but cheerful
- Energy is good (70%), fuel is adequate (50.9%)
- University District has 1.3x surge (higher than here)

This is a solid ride that will take me to a zone with even better surge. I'll accept it.

💭 [Model says]:
Good situation analysis:
- I'm tired (59 energy) with -5% tip penalty and 20% slower travel
- Surge at 1.5x in University (unusual!) and Downtown
- Only 3 drivers in University with 5 pending requests (good supply/demand ratio)
- Fuel at 45.1% is manageable for now
- Available ride: University → Downtown, 3 miles, $7.84 net at 1.5x surge with cheerful, talkative passenger

This ride takes me to Downtown which also has 1.5x surge. The passenger is cheerful and talkative, so I should engage positively. Despite being tired, I need to work through this since I'm at Day 3 midday and need to maximize earnings.

💭 [Model says]:
Excellent! I've made $164.86 today with 5 rides, and my balance is $283.73. With pending tips of $32.95, my net worth is $316.68. 

Current situation:
- Energy: 59 (tired) - affecting performance
- It's 1pm, rush hour starts at 5pm (4 hours away)
- No immediate events
- Fuel: 44.3% (after that last ride)

Strategic decision: I should rest for 2-3 hours to recover energy, then be fresh for the evening rush hour when demand peaks. Being tired reduces tips by 5% and slows travel by 20%, hurting my earnings potential during the most profitable time of day.

- +5% tips bonus
- +0.1 rating bonus

💭 [Model says]:
Great! I'm well-rested with 92 energy, 100% acceptance rate, and 43.4% fuel. The Airport has the best surge at 1.5x with 5 pending requests and only needs 15 miles to reach. Business District is very close (1 mile) with 1.2x surge and 5 pending requests.

Airport runs are longer and have better tips from travelers. With my fuel at 43.4% (about 5.2 gallons), I have roughly 156-197 miles of range. The Airport is a strategic choice for higher earnings.

💭 [Model says]:
Excellent situation! I'm:
- Rested with 84 energy
- At the airport with 1.8x surge (highest in the city)
- Only 9 drivers competing for 2 pending requests
- Good rating at 4.62
- 100% acceptance rate

Fuel is at 38%, which gives me 138 miles. Airport gas is expensive ($5.49 vs $4.00 in suburbs), but I should stay online and grab these high-surge rides first. I can refuel later in a cheaper zone.

Let me go online and see what rides are available:

  "success": false,
  "error": "Already online. No action needed."

💭 [Model says]:
No pending requests at the moment despite the data showing 2 pending. They likely just got picked up. With 1.8x surge still active at the airport, I'll wait here for the next request to come in. The airport typically has consistent demand throughout the day (5am-11pm peak). 

Let me advance to the next hour and catch the incoming requests:

Perfect situation! I have:
- Good energy (76%)
- 2.0x surge at airport (excellent)
- A high-paying ride ($37.84 net fare) from Airport to Downtown (15.1 miles)
- Decent fuel (37.6% = ~4.5 gallons, enough for this ride and more)
- Passenger is a 4.4 rated talkative traveler

This is an excellent ride - long distance with 2.0x surge multiplier. After dropping off downtown, I'll be perfectly positioned for the evening rush hour (5-7pm) which is approaching. Let me accept this immediately.

- No immediate ride requests in Downtown (demand is building for rush hour)

With 11 minutes left in the hour and fuel at 33.4%, I should wait for the next hour when evening rush hour really kicks in (5pm/17:00). Downtown should surge higher during the peak 5-7pm window.

Excellent position! Balance: $370.45, pending tips: $64.91. I'm at 54 energy (tired), fuel at 22.8% (about 82 miles range). It's 7 PM on Wednesday - prime evening time.

Looking at zones:
- Airport: 2.5x surge, 5 pending requests (but 17 miles away - too far with low fuel)
- Downtown: 2.2x surge, 0 pending (2 miles away)
- Business District: 2.0x surge, 1 pending (3 miles away)
- Nightlife: 1.0x surge currently, 7 pending requests (I'm here!)

The nightlife surge will increase as the evening progresses (9 PM-3 AM peak). However, I need to refuel soon. Let me check for rides in my current zone first, then decide whether to refuel or move.

No requests showing in Nightlife despite 7 being listed. With my low fuel (22.8%) and tired status (54 energy), I should refuel before continuing. Gas is $5.17 here but suburbs are $4.00 (10 miles away). Given my fuel situation, I should refuel here now to avoid running too low.

No requests showing. At 54 energy (tired) after 9 hours of work, I'm hitting the fatigue penalty (-5% tips, 20% slower travel). However, I've had a very profitable day ($283.54 today). 

Let me check current zone conditions and then decide whether to push through or rest.

💭 [Model says]:
Interesting - no pending requests in Downtown despite 2.2x surge. The system shows hour 18 but I just moved to hour 19. Airport still has 2.5x surge with 5 pending requests.

Given my tired state (54 energy) and the strong day I've had ($283.54), I have two strategic options:
1. Push through for a few more hours to capitalize on evening demand
2. Rest now to recover energy for tomorrow

Since nightlife peak is 9 PM-3 AM and I'm tired, I'll rest for 2 hours to recover some energy (30 points), then work the late night shift when Nightlife district surges and there are fewer drivers.

💭 [Model says]:
Interesting! I can see that Downtown (2.0x surge) and Airport (2.2x surge) have much better surge pricing right now. However, I have a decent ride request here that will take me toward the Residential area. 

The ride pays $11.82 net for 6.1 miles and 18 minutes - that's reasonable. But Downtown is only 2 miles away with 2.0x surge and 6 pending requests. That's a much better opportunity.

I'll decline this ride and reposition to Downtown where the surge is significantly higher.

Excellent! I'm in Nightlife District with 2.2x surge, only 3 active drivers, and 4 pending requests. This is a goldmine despite being tired. The surge more than compensates for the 5% tip penalty from fatigue. Let me check for ride requests now.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm tired (41% energy) with reduced performance, but this is a 2.5x surge ride during peak nightlife hours. The ride is short (3 miles, 13 minutes) and will net me $11.16. The passenger is irritated and not talkative, which is actually fine given my tired state - I don't need to engage in heavy conversation.

Given that:
- This is prime nightlife surge time (11pm Wednesday)
- I'm at 85% fuel (plenty for this short ride)
- My rating is solid at 4.61
- The ride is quick and profitable with surge
- After this ride I should rest before midnight

I'll accept this ride, complete it, then rest to recover energy.

Perfect! I'm rested (84 energy), in excellent condition, and it's prime nightlife hours (1 AM). I see:
- Airport has 1.5x surge with 5 pending requests - best opportunity
- Nightlife has 1.2x surge with 1 pending request - where I am now
- Residential has 7 pending requests at 1.0x surge

The Airport is 17 miles away with 1.5x surge and good demand. That's the smart move - airport rides typically pay well and passengers tip generously. Let me go online first to check what's available locally, then decide whether to relocate.

No requests showing in my current zone despite the data showing 1 pending. The Airport has the best surge (1.5x) and 5 pending requests. At 1 AM, airport travelers are likely arriving on late flights - these are typically good tippers who value efficiency. The 17-mile drive will use about 0.45 gallons (17/38 MPG highway), but the 1.5x surge makes it worthwhile.

💭 [Model says]:
Good situation! I have:
- 68 energy (normal, good to continue)
- 92.9% acceptance rate (excellent)
- 75.2% fuel (plenty)
- Currently at Airport with 1.2x surge
- Nightlife has 2.0x surge (17 miles away)

It's 3 PM, which is mid-afternoon. The airport is decent, but Nightlife at 2.0x surge is interesting. However, Nightlife typically peaks at night (9pm-3am), so 2.0x at 3 PM might be unusual. With only 2 pending requests and 6 drivers there, it might not be sustainable.

The airport typically operates well from 5am-11pm with travelers who tip generously. With 1.2x surge and only 2 pending requests vs 9 drivers here, I should go online and see what's available. If nothing good, I might relocate.

💭 [Model says]:
No requests at the airport currently. With 9 drivers and only 2 pending requests total, the competition is high here. The Nightlife district at 2.0x surge with only 6 drivers and 2 pending requests might be worthwhile, though it's 17 miles away. Alternatively, Suburbs has 7 pending requests with only 3 drivers and 1.0x surge at 12 miles.

Given the time of day (3 PM), Suburbs makes more sense - families needing rides. Nightlife won't really pick up until evening. Let me head to Suburbs where there's better demand-to-driver ratio.

Good situation analysis:
- It's 4:00 PM - approaching evening rush hour (5-7 PM)
- Energy: 60% (normal condition, good to drive)
- Fuel: 71.1% (plenty for now)
- Rating: 4.61 (above warning threshold)
- Currently in Suburbs with no pending requests

The evening rush hour is approaching. I should position myself strategically for the 5-7 PM surge. Best options:
1. **Residential Area** (3 miles away, 4 requests) - close by for evening commuters
2. **Business District** (9 miles away, 3 requests) - will have high demand during rush hour
3. **Downtown** (8 miles away, 2 requests) - prime for evening rush hour

I'll head to the **Business District** now to catch the beginning of the evening rush. This positions me well for high-paying business commuters leaving work.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm at 52% energy (tired), which is affecting my performance with 20% slower travel and -5% tips. It's 5:00 PM on Thursday - this is the START of evening rush hour (5-7pm), which is a prime earning time in Downtown and Residential areas. However, I need to balance this against my fatigue.

Looking at the zones:
- **Downtown**: 1 mile away, 1.0x surge, but evening rush is starting (should increase soon)
- **Airport**: 1.2x surge already, but 16 miles away and I'm tired
- **Business District**: Where I am now, only 3 pending requests with 11 drivers (oversaturated)

Since it's 5 PM and the evening rush hour is just starting, Downtown should surge soon. I should move to Downtown NOW to catch the rush hour surge (typically 5-7pm). Even though I'm tired, this is peak earning time and I can push through another 1-2 hours before resting.

💭 [Model says]:
Good! I'm at 44 energy (tired), which is still manageable. It's 6am Thursday morning - this is prime morning rush hour starting soon. My analysis:

**Current Situation:**
- Energy: 44 (tired) - 20% slower, -5% tips, -0.1 rating
- Balance: $372.19 - solid
- Fuel: 66.6% - good
- Rating: 4.61 - acceptable but could be better
- It's 6am on Day 4 - morning commute starting

**Zone Analysis:**
- Airport: 1.5x surge, only 5 drivers, 2 pending requests - excellent opportunity
- Residential: 1.2x surge, 7 pending requests
- Morning rush (7-9am) will hit soon

**Strategy:** 
Despite being tired, 6am is early in the morning rush. Airport has 1.5x surge with low driver count. I should go there now before the surge increases and capitalize on early traveler demand. My energy is manageable (44 is "tired" but not exhausted), and the airport typically has good tips which will offset my -5% penalty.

Let me head to the Airport now to catch the early morning travel surge:

Good situation:

- In suburbs with cheapest gas ($4.00)
- Airport still has 2.5x surge!
- Business District has 1.8x surge
- Residential nearby has 1.8x surge

The airport's 2.5x surge is still active. That's 12 miles away but worth it for potentially another high-paying ride. Let me head back to the airport to capitalize on that surge while it lasts.

💭 [Model says]:
Good situation! I'm in Business District with 1.8x surge and 4 pending requests. My energy is at 51 (tired status), which means I'm taking a -5% tip penalty and 20% slower travel, but I can still work effectively. With 47.9% fuel remaining (~172 miles), I have enough fuel for several more rides before needing to refuel.

My acceptance rate is excellent at 92.9%, and I'm maintaining a 4.61 rating. Let me go online and capture these high-surge rides in the Business District.

No ride requests at the moment despite 4 pending requests in the zone. This might mean they were just taken by other drivers. With 1.8x surge in Business District and Downtown, I'll wait for the next hour to see if new requests come in. Both zones have excellent surge multipliers right now.

Let me advance to the next hour to continue working this surge period.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm tired (43 energy) which is hurting my performance with 20% slower travel and reduced tips. However, I have a 1.3x surge here and only 2 pending requests in Business District. Downtown also has 1.3x surge with 7 pending requests - much better demand.

My energy is critically low. I should rest to recover, but let me check if going online briefly could catch one quick ride before I rest. Actually, with my fatigue penalty, I'm better off resting now to maximize afternoon/evening earnings.

Let me rest for 2-3 hours to get back to normal energy levels, then work the afternoon rush.

💭 [Model says]:
Good status overall - energy is at 61 (normal), rating is decent at 4.60, and I have 92.86% acceptance rate. Airport has the best surge at 1.5x with 6 pending requests. Downtown is also good at 1.3x. My fuel is at 41.5% which should be adequate for now.

I should move to the Airport zone for the higher surge (1.5x) and more pending requests (6 vs 3 here). The 16-mile trip will use fuel but the higher fares will compensate.

I'm tired (53 energy) with reduced performance, but the 1.8x surge at the airport is too good to pass up. My fuel is at 36% which is manageable for now. Although there are currently no pending requests showing up (they may be getting matched to other drivers), the airport has 2 pending requests in the zone. Let me go online to catch rides at this surge rate.

💭 [Model says]:
Good situation! I have:
- 2.0x surge at Airport (excellent!)
- $42.89 net fare for a 17.1 mile ride to University District
- Energy at 45% (tired but manageable)
- Fuel at 35.4% (4.2 gallons, enough for this ride)

The ride is long and profitable with the 2.0x surge multiplier. Even though I'm tired (-5% tips, 20% slower), the high fare makes it worthwhile. After this ride, I should refuel and rest.

Excellent! Earned $45.92 with a decent tip despite being tired. Now I'm at University District with 30.7% fuel remaining (3.68 gallons) and energy at 42% (used 3 more energy for the ride). 

It's now hour 17:00. I should:
1. Head to suburbs to refuel (cheapest gas)
2. Then rest to recover energy before evening rush

I see it's 17:00 (5 PM) - approaching evening rush hour! Airport still has 2.0x surge and Downtown is at 1.3x. However, my energy is at 42% (tired) and I've been working 17+ hours. 

Let me think strategically:
- Evening rush (5-7pm) is starting soon - high earning potential
- But I'm tired (-5% tips, 20% slower travel)
- Fuel at 30.7% is manageable for a few more rides
- If I rest now (2 hours), I'll recover to 72% energy and be fresh for the peak evening rush

I'll go offline, drive to suburbs for cheap gas, refuel, then rest for 2 hours to be fresh for the evening rush.

- A 16.1-mile ride from Airport to Business District
- 2.2x surge multiplier = $43.79 net fare
- 54-minute ride duration
- Passenger is a 4.5-rated Canadian businesswoman, not very talkative (which is fine)
- My energy is at 64 (Normal), rating 4.59, acceptance rate 92.9%
- Fuel is at 95.8% - plenty for this ride

This is an excellent fare during peak hours. I'll accept it immediately.

I'm tired (53% energy) after 19 hours of driving, but this is peak surge time across multiple zones. Downtown has 2.2x surge with 7 pending requests, and Airport has 2.5x with 6 requests. Even though I'm tired (-5% tips, 20% slower), the surge multipliers more than compensate. I'll push through this hour to maximize earnings, then rest.

- Downtown still at 2.0x surge with 1 request (8 miles away)
- Suburbs has 1.5x surge but no requests showing yet

No special events. Airport has 2.2x surge with 5 requests. That's worth positioning for, even though I'm tired. The reduced tips from fatigue are offset by the high surge. I'll drive to the airport and try to catch another high-value ride before considering rest.

This is concerning - I'm exhausted with only 34 energy (5% accident risk, 50% slower travel, -15% tips). I've worked 21 hours straight! Despite the 2.0x surge at the airport, continuing to drive while exhausted is counterproductive and dangerous.

The smart move is to rest now and come back strong for the nightlife surge (which typically peaks around 11pm-2am). Let me go offline and rest.

Good, now let me rest for 4 hours to recover energy. This will take me to midnight (hour 24/00:00), and I'll be fully recharged for the peak nightlife hours when surge can hit 2-3x.

It's midnight now (the hour advanced during rest). The nightlife district has 1.5x surge and 7 pending requests - that's the hot zone! Airport still has 2.0x surge but no pending requests. I should head to nightlife to catch the late-night party crowd who tend to give variable but often good tips, especially with my rested energy bonus.

Let me drive to the nightlife district (17 miles, about 0.45 gallons at 38 MPG highway).

I'm in an excellent position - Hour 3:00 AM on a Friday in the Nightlife District with a 2.6x surge! This is prime time for high-value rides. Let me check my status and capitalize on this surge.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm exhausted (38 energy) which means I'm operating at reduced efficiency. However, I'm at 3 AM on a Friday with a 2.6x surge in Nightlife - this is literally the peak earning time. The question is whether to push through for a couple more high-value rides or rest.

Given that:
- I have decent fuel (72.2%)
- My rating is stable at 4.59
- 2.6x surge is excellent
- It's 3 AM (nightlife ends around 3 AM typically, so demand will drop soon)

I'll stay online to catch one or two more high-value rides during this surge window, then rest. The -15% tip penalty is worth it for the 2.6x multiplier.

I'm exhausted with only 30 energy (50% slower, -15% tips, 5% accident risk), but there are no pending ride requests at the moment. At 4 AM Friday in the Nightlife District, demand is likely winding down. Given my exhausted state and no immediate high-value opportunities, I should rest to recover energy before the morning rush hour starts.

Let me go offline and rest to prepare for the lucrative morning commute period (7-9 AM).

Interesting! The Nightlife District still has 2.0x surge and 7 pending requests with only 4 active drivers. This is unusual for 7:00 AM (the system shows hour 4, but after my 3-hour rest it should be 7 AM). The Airport also has more pending requests (7) than drivers (6). Let me go online here in Nightlife to catch these high-surge rides first.

Good situation analysis:
- Energy: 67 (normal) - I can continue driving but need rest soon
- Balance: $520.33 - solid position
- Rating: 4.59 - good, above warning threshold
- Fuel: 70.6% - sufficient
- Current zone has 1.3x surge (highest right now)
- Airport has 1.2x surge with 7 pending requests
- It's 5:00 AM Friday - early morning airport runs will start picking up soon

Strategy: I'm already in Nightlife with the best surge. Let me go online and grab rides here while the surge is active, then potentially shift to the airport for early morning travelers.

I'm tired (51 energy) after working 11 hours this shift, which means 20% slower travel and -5% tips. This is Friday morning rush hour with excellent opportunities:

- **Airport**: 2.0x surge with good demand
- **Residential**: 1.5x surge (morning commuters)
- **Nightlife**: 1.3x surge

However, being tired is hurting my earnings. I should rest to recover energy before capitalizing on the weekend. Let me rest for 2 hours to get back to normal performance, then work the prime Friday evening and weekend hours at full capacity.

Perfect! I've rested from 7am to 9am and recovered 30 energy, bringing me to 81 energy (rested status). Now I'm at 9am on Friday with excellent mood and full capacity (+5% tips, +0.1 rating bonus). This is perfect timing - I'll be fresh for the entire day and weekend ahead.

Now it's 9am, still good time to catch business commuters and then work through the day. Let me check the current situation and go online.

💭 [Model says]:
Great situation! My balance is now $573.88 with $15.54 in pending tips. I'm at 50% fuel. Looking at the zones:
- **Airport: 2.5x surge, 6 pending requests** - still hot!
- **Business District: 1.8x surge, 1 pending request** - closer at 4 miles
- **Residential: 1.8x surge, 3 pending requests** - 8 miles away
- **Downtown: 1.5x surge** - 3 miles away

The airport still has the best surge at 2.5x with 6 pending requests, but it's 18 miles away. It's Friday morning at 8am, so rush hour is still going strong. Business District at 1.8x is only 4 miles away. Given that I only have 3 minutes left in this hour, let me head to Business District now and catch rides there.

Good situation! I'm at 54% energy (tired but manageable), have excellent 1.8x surge, and there's a decent ride request. The passenger Jose Lopez seems like a good match - cheerful and talkative. The ride pays $13.30 net and takes me to Residential (which has pending requests). My fuel at 38.4% is adequate for several more rides.

I'll accept this ride and continue working to maximize earnings during this surge period. I can rest later when surge drops.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm tired (43 energy) and have been working 15 hours straight. However, I have an excellent ride opportunity: a $28.56 net fare airport run with 1.3x surge. This is a high-value ride that will take me to the airport where I can refuel if needed.

Given my energy situation, I should:
1. Accept this lucrative airport ride
2. Complete it
3. Then rest to recover energy

The airport run is worth it despite being tired because:
- High fare ($28.56 net)
- Takes me to airport (good demand zone)
- I have enough fuel (34.7% = ~4.2 gallons, enough for 14.3 miles)

Good situation:

- Energy: 40 (tired - need to rest)
- Fuel: 30.7% (sufficient for now)
- At Airport with expensive gas ($5.49/gal)

I should go offline and rest to recover energy. With 40 energy and being tired, I'm losing 5% on tips and have 20% slower travel. I'll rest for 3 hours to get back to ~85 energy (40 + 45 = 85), which will put me in "rested" status for better performance.

💭 [Model says]:
Interesting - the hour is still showing as 11, which means the rest advanced time but we're still technically in that period. I'm at the airport with:
- 30.7% fuel (3.7 gallons, ~110 miles)
- 85 energy (rested status!)
- Airport gas is expensive ($5.49 vs $4.00 in suburbs)

Strategy: I should refuel in the suburbs to save money, then position for the evening rush (5-7pm downtown is peak). But it's still hour 11 (around 2pm Friday), so I have time. Let me refuel at the cheaper suburbs location, then head to a good zone for afternoon business.

Actually, with 30.7% fuel, I have ~110 miles of range. That's enough for several rides. I'll go online at the airport first since there's 1.3x surge here and pending requests, do a ride or two, then refuel in suburbs later when I'm closer.

Good situation: Energy at 77% (normal), excellent vehicle condition, and a solid ride request. The ride is Airport to Suburbs - $21.98 net fare, 12.9 miles with 1.2x surge. However, my fuel is at 29.9% (107 miles range), and I need about 13 miles for this ride. After this ride, I'll be in the suburbs where gas is cheapest.

This is an excellent ride:
- Airport runs typically get good tips
- 15.1 miles at 1.5x surge = solid earnings

💭 [Model says]:
Good situation analysis:
- I'm tired (55 energy) which gives me -5% tips and 20% slower travel, but still operational
- Airport has 1.5x surge with 6 pending requests and 12 drivers
- I've worked 18 hours this shift - energy is a concern
- Fuel is good at 90.5%, rating is solid at 4.57
- Balance is healthy at $632.49

The airport surge is excellent, but I'm tired. However, I'm not exhausted yet (that's at 40%), so I can still work profitably. Let me check what rides are available and grab one before going offline to rest.

💭 [Model says]:
No requests available right now despite 6 pending requests showing in zone info - they must have been taken by other drivers. With 12 drivers competing for 6 requests, it's competitive. 

Given my tired state (55 energy), I should rest soon to avoid dropping into exhausted territory (below 40%). However, the 1.5x surge is good money. Let me wait this hour to see if any requests come in, and if not, I'll go offline and rest to recover energy for the evening rush.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm exhausted (energy at 39) after 20 hours of work, which means 50% slower travel, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk. This is seriously hurting my earnings. However, I'm at the airport with 2.0x surge and there's 1 pending request. 

The smart play is to rest NOW before continuing. But let me check if I'm currently online and what rides are available first:

💭 [Model says]:
I'm not seeing requests because I'm likely offline. Given my exhausted state, I need to make a critical decision. Working exhausted gives me:
- 50% slower travel (killing efficiency)
- -15% tips (losing money)
- 5% accident risk (could be catastrophic)

Even with 2.0x surge, exhausted performance will significantly hurt earnings. I should rest for 2-3 hours to get back to "normal" status (60+ energy), then work the Friday evening/night surge when I'm more effective.

Perfect! I have a high-value ride request: $48.48 net fare with 2.5x surge going to Nightlife District. Even though I'm tired (53 energy), this is too good to pass up - Friday evening with excellent surge pricing. The ride will take me to Nightlife which should start surging soon as the evening progresses.

The passenger is a 73-year-old with a good 4.7 rating and is talkative - I'll need to engage in conversation despite being tired.

I'm now at $680.97 balance with $50.80 pending tips - total net worth of $731.77! Great progress. I'm at 50 energy (tired) but it's Friday evening prime time. The Nightlife zone currently has low surge (1.3x) but it's only 7 PM - it should surge heavily later (9 PM - 3 AM is peak). 

However, I'm tired which is affecting my performance. Let me strategically check what's happening in other zones and decide whether to push through or rest briefly. Downtown has 2.2x surge right now.

No pending requests here yet. Let me wait for the next hour to see if Nightlife picks up, or I could move to Downtown which has 2.2x surge currently.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm at 42 energy (tired level) with warnings about reduced performance. However, I'm in an excellent position - Friday evening in the Nightlife District with 1.6x surge that will increase. Airport has 2.2x surge and Downtown has 2.0x.

The issue is my energy level. I've been working 23 hours this shift and I'm tired, which means:
- 20% slower travel times
- -5% tips
- -0.1 rating penalty

However, Friday night in the Nightlife District is one of the most profitable times of the week. The surge will likely climb to 2.0-3.0x as we approach peak hours (9pm-3am). I need to balance immediate earnings opportunity against performance penalties.

Given my strong balance ($680.97) and the fact that it's prime earning time, I'll push through for a few more hours to capitalize on surge pricing, then rest. Let me go online and see what rides are available.

💭 [Model says]:
No pending requests right now. With 6 pending requests in the zone according to zone info, they're likely being served by the 12 drivers here. Airport has 2.2x surge with 3 pending requests and only 10 drivers - that's a better opportunity. Downtown also has 2.0x surge with fewer drivers.

However, given I'm tired (20% slower travel), the 17-mile trip to airport would be inefficient. Downtown is only 2 miles away with 2.0x surge. But since it's Friday night and Nightlife surge will only increase, I'll wait here for the next hour to catch the rising surge.

Perfect! I've recovered to 100% energy and I'm now rested. It's now Hour 01:00 Saturday morning (Day 6). The Nightlife District should be absolutely popping at 1 AM on a Saturday - this is when bars start closing and surge pricing goes extreme (potentially 3.0x). Time to go back online and capitalize!

I'm tired (44% energy) which reduces my performance, but I'm in the Nightlife District at 3 AM with 2.6x surge - this is peak earnings time! Even with the fatigue penalty, the surge multiplier more than compensates. However, there are currently no ride requests available.

Let me go online and wait for requests to come in. The nightlife zone at 3 AM on Saturday should have plenty of demand.

I'm exhausted (36% energy) after working 8 hours this shift, which is severely impacting my performance. Although there's a 2.0x surge in Nightlife, there are no pending requests right now, and my exhausted state means 50% slower travel, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk.

💭 [Model says]:
No requests in Nightlife right now. Airport still has 2.0x surge with 3 pending requests, but that's 17 miles away. Residential has 1.5x surge with 6 requests and is only 7 miles away. However, I'm tired and should consider my energy situation.

Strategic decision: I've been working 11 hours and I'm tired. But it's Saturday and there will be good earning opportunities today and tonight. Let me take a 2-hour rest now (will recover 30 energy, bringing me to 84% - "Rested" status), then come back strong for the rest of Saturday which should be lucrative.

Perfect! I have:
- Good energy at 68% (normal condition)
- A solid ride request: Airport → Nightlife District, $43.13 net fare with 2.0x surge
- 46.8% fuel (about 5.6 gallons, enough for this ride)
- Business District has even higher surge at 2.2x

This is an excellent fare with the 2.0x surge multiplier. The passenger Ana has a decent 4.1 rating and is talkative. After this ride, I'll be in the Nightlife District at 10am on a Saturday - not ideal timing since nightlife peaks late at night, but I can reposition afterward. Let me accept this ride!

💭 [Model says]:
I'm tired (49% energy) which is impacting my performance with -5% tips and 20% slower travel. However, I'm on Day 6 and need to maximize earnings. My fuel is at 39.5%, which should be sufficient for a few more rides before refueling. I'm in a good position with 1.3x surge and 6 pending requests in my zone.

Let me go online and check available rides:

💭 [Model says]:
No current requests for me. Since I'm tired and there's no immediate surge opportunity, this might be a good time to rest. However, it's Saturday mid-day and nightlife surge will start building around 9pm tonight. Let me consider my options:

1. Rest now (3-4 hours) to recover energy for tonight's nightlife surge
2. Continue working through the tiredness

Given that I'm at 49% energy (tired), and nightlife surge is still 10 hours away, I should rest now for 3 hours to get back to good energy levels (49 + 45 = 94%), then work the lucrative Saturday night shift.

Good status! Energy is at 86 (rested), rating 4.57, and I have $765.68. It's Saturday afternoon with moderate demand across the board. I notice:

- University District has highest surge at 1.3x and is only 4 miles away
- Nightlife District also has 1.3x surge, 3 miles away
- Fuel is at 38.6% - still good for now
- No special events happening

Since it's Saturday at noon, I should position for the afternoon/evening rush. University and Nightlife both have better surge than my current location. Let me go online and check what rides are available first.

Good situation analysis:
- Energy: 70 (Normal) - can continue driving
- Fuel: 35.8% (4.3 gallons, ~129 miles) - need to refuel soon
- Airport has best surge at 1.5x and is 18 miles away
- I'm on Day 6, need to maximize earnings before end of Day 7
- Only 1 pending request in University (students = low tips)

Strategy: First refuel at cheapest location (suburbs at $4.00/gallon), then head to Airport for better surge and tips. Airport travelers tip well and it's Saturday afternoon - good travel time.

Excellent! I have:
- 62% energy (normal - good to continue)
- 4.57 rating (solid)
- 92.8% acceptance rate (excellent)
- 1.8x surge at airport (highest in the city!)
- No pending requests at airport currently, but high demand

The airport has strong surge but 11 active drivers and 0 pending requests at this moment. Suburbs has 1.0x surge but 7 pending requests with only 4 drivers - that's much better supply/demand balance. Let me go online first to see what's available here, since I'm already positioned at the airport with excellent surge.

💭 [Model says]:
Great situation! I'm tired (54 energy) but it's Saturday evening peak time with surges across the city. The airport has 2.0x surge with decent demand. I have 7 pending requests right here in suburbs with 1.2x surge. 

Key observations:
- Airport: 2.0x surge, but 12 miles away and I'm tired (20% slower travel)
- Suburbs: 1.2x surge with 7 pending requests right here
- I'm at 54 energy (tired), affecting tips and travel speed
- Good fuel at 91.7%

Since I'm tired and it's prime earning time on Saturday evening, I should work this hour and then rest. The suburbs have 7 pending requests, so I'll go online here rather than waste fuel/time driving tired to the airport.

No ride requests showing even though the zone info said 7 pending. This sometimes happens with timing. The airport has the best surge at 2.0x. Even though I'm tired, this is Day 6 Saturday evening - prime earning time. I should position myself at the airport for that 2.0x surge.

Excellent! Saturday at 5pm with 2.2x surge at the airport - this is prime time. I have a solid $46.67 net fare ride to Nightlife District. Even though I'm tired (46 energy), this is too good to pass up, especially since it's Day 6 and I need to maximize earnings. The passenger is a 73-year-old woman with a decent rating who's talkative.

After this ride, I'll be in the Nightlife District which will start surging heavily as evening approaches (it's Saturday night!). I can complete this ride and potentially catch more high-surge nightlife rides, then rest later.

💭 [Model says]:
Good position: $780.18 balance, plus $20.70 in pending tips = ~$800.89 net worth. I'm at 43 energy (tired), and it's hour 18 (6pm) on Saturday in the Nightlife District. The zone currently has 1.3x surge, but this will skyrocket as the night progresses (9pm-3am is peak nightlife hours).

Strategic decision: I should rest now for a few hours to recover energy, then come back online around 9-10pm when the nightlife surge hits 2-3x. This way I'll be fresh for the most lucrative period. Working tired during peak nightlife hours would cost me tips and rating.

💭 [Model says]:
Excellent! I'm well-rested (80 energy) with a solid rating of 4.58. Saturday night at 6pm - the nightlife zone will explode with demand soon. However, I notice:

- **Airport has 2.5x surge RIGHT NOW** with 5 pending requests (high demand)
- **Downtown has 2.2x surge** 
- Nightlife is only at 1.3x but will spike hard later (9pm-3am)

I have two strategic options:
1. Stay in nightlife and wait for the surge to build (9pm+)
2. Capitalize on the airport surge NOW (2.5x with 5 pending requests)

Airport is 17 miles away - about 0.45 gallons of fuel. With 81.8% fuel (9.8 gallons), I'm good. The airport surge NOW might be better than waiting 3 hours for nightlife to peak. Let me go online and see what's available here first.

Great situation analysis:

- Airport surge: 2.2x (highest in the city!)
- Balance: $780.18 with $20.70 pending tips
- Fuel: 76.2% (good)
- Rating: 4.58 (solid)
- No pending requests at airport currently but still high surge

Downtown has 2.0x surge with 5 pending requests and only 6 drivers. Since there are no requests here right now, I'll move to downtown to capture those high-surge rides. The 15-mile trip will use some fuel but the 2.0x surge downtown with less competition (6 vs 11 drivers) is worth it.

Good! My energy is at 64 (normal), and I see:
- Current ride: Downtown → Suburbs, 8.1 miles, $17.82 net at 1.5x surge
- Airport has 2.0x surge with 7 pending requests (15 miles away)
- Nightlife has 2.0x surge with only 1 request (2 miles away, very close!)

Saturday night at 8pm - Nightlife zone is ramping up and has 2.0x surge. However, the current ride pays $17.82 for 8.1 miles which is decent. After completing it, I'll be in Suburbs which has cheap gas ($4.00).

Let me accept this ride, complete it, refuel in suburbs at the cheap price, then head to Nightlife zone which should be peaking soon (9pm-3am are prime nightlife hours).

💭 [Model says]:
This is a tough call. I'm exhausted (37 energy) which means:
- 50% slower travel (50 min → 75 min trip)
- -15% tips
- 5% accident risk
- -0.3 rating penalty

BUT this is a fantastic ride:
- $54.81 net fare (3.0x surge!)
- Long airport run
- Good passenger (4.9 rating)
- Takes me to airport for potential morning rides

Given that:
1. This is Day 6, Hour 23 - only 25 hours left in the simulation
2. $54.81 is a huge fare that could boost my final earnings significantly
3. I have high fuel (94.7%)
4. My rating is decent at 4.58
5. After this ride I can rest before the final day push

I'll take this ride despite being exhausted. The earnings potential is too high to pass up, and I'll rest after.

Excellent! Despite being exhausted, I earned $58.79 on that ride - a massive boost! The exhaustion did hurt my rating (got 4.2 from passenger, dropping me slightly to 4.56), but the earnings were worth it.

Now I'm at the airport at Hour 1 (past midnight, Day 7). I should rest to recover energy before the final day push. Let me check the situation and then rest.

Great situation! Balance: $837.91, with $28.82 in pending tips = $866.73 net worth. I'm exhausted (34 energy) and need to rest. It's now Day 7, Hour 1 (past midnight). I have 23 hours left in the simulation.

Wait, the output shows Hour 23 Day 6 still - that's because events/zones show the current state. I just rested 5 hours, so it should be Hour 6 Day 7 (or actually Hour 4-5 Day 7 based on when the ride completed).

I'm at the airport with 90.2% fuel, excellent condition, fully rested. Airport has 1.5x surge with 3 requests. Nightlife still has 3.0x surge with 3 requests but it's 17 miles away.

Since I'm already at the airport and rested, I should go online here and work the morning. Airport is good for early morning travelers. Then I can position for evening rush later.

Perfect! I'm well-rested (92 energy), it's the final day, and I see:
- A $25.39 net fare ride from Airport to Suburbs with 1.5x surge
- Nightlife district has 2.6x surge (but it's midnight Sunday - last call crowd wrapping up)
- I have excellent fuel (89.4%) and good positioning

The Airport to Suburbs ride is solid with the surge multiplier. After completing it, I'll be in the suburbs where gas is cheapest ($4.00 vs $5.49 at airport). Then I can reposition to nightlife for the high surge or stay flexible.

Let me accept this ride and maximize Day 7 earnings!

Perfect! I have:

- A solid ride request with 2.6x surge paying $11.03 net

This is a great opportunity. The surge is high, the fare is good, and I have plenty of fuel (80.9%). I'll accept this ride immediately.

I'm tired but it's the final day and I'm in a great position with the highest surge. The nightlife surge at 5am is perfect for catching late-night partiers heading home. I'll push through to maximize earnings on this last day, then rest later when surge drops.

No requests at the moment. The system shows 5 pending requests in the zone but none available to me yet. I'll wait for the next hour when more requests should come in. The nightlife surge should continue as people head home, and I can also catch early morning airport demand soon.

💭 [Model says]:
Critical situation! I'm EXHAUSTED (38 energy) which means:
- 50% slower travel times
- -15% tips
- 5% accident risk
- This is seriously hurting my earnings

However, it's the final day and I need to maximize earnings. The Airport has 1.5x surge with 4 pending requests and only 17 miles away. But first, I MUST rest to recover energy or I'll continue bleeding earnings.

Let me go offline and rest for 3 hours to get back to a reasonable energy level, then capitalize on the rest of the day.

- Energy: 67% (Normal) - can continue driving
- Fuel: 67.5% - plenty to work with
- Only 1 pending request here vs 6 at Airport

💭 [Model says]:
Excellent situation! It's Sunday morning at 9 AM, the final day. I have:
- $874.33 balance + $6.85 pending tips = $881.18 net worth
- 59% energy (tired but manageable for now)
- 63.9% fuel (about 7.7 gallons)
- 2.0x surge at Airport with 2 pending requests
- Downtown also has 2.0x surge with 6 pending requests
- Business District has 2.2x surge but no pending requests

I'm tired but this is the final day, and I'm at the Airport with 2.0x surge. I need to push through and maximize these remaining hours. Let me go online and grab rides while the surge is hot.

💭 [Model says]:
Good position! It's 11 AM Sunday, final day. I'm tired (43 energy) but it's the last day - I need to push through to maximize earnings. I'm at $881.18 net worth with 13 hours left. Key observations:

- Business District has 1.3x surge with 3 pending requests
- I'm tired (20% slower, -5% tips, -0.1 rating)
- Fuel at 57.8% is decent
- Sunday 11 AM - moderate demand across zones
- No events scheduled

Strategy: I should rest for 2-3 hours to recover some energy, then work the afternoon/evening rush. But since it's the FINAL day and I only have 13 hours left, I need to balance rest vs. earnings maximization.

Let me go online and see what rides are available first:

   Args: {}
   Result: {

}

💭 [Model says]:
No requests right now in Business District. Since it's the final day and I'm tired, let me take a strategic 2-hour rest to recover energy (from 43 to 73), then work the afternoon and evening strong. This will help me avoid the -5% tip penalty and -0.1 rating penalty.

I'm tired (57 energy) but it's Day 7 at 1pm - I have 11 hours left to maximize earnings. The current ride request is decent: $14.93 net fare with 1.3x surge to Residential Area. Downtown has 1.5x surge with good demand, and University also has 1.5x surge.

I'll accept this ride since I'm already here and it's profitable, then reposition to a higher surge zone.

💭 [Model says]:
Good situation analysis:
- Balance: $889.25 + $9.03 pending = $898.28 net worth
- Only 10 hours left (ending at midnight/hour 0, Day 8)
- Energy at 46% (tired) - this is reducing my efficiency and tips by 5%
- Fuel at 51.3% - adequate for now
- Airport has 1.5x surge (best multiplier)
- I'm tired but with only 10 hours left, I need to push through strategically

Strategy: With only 10 hours remaining, I need to maximize earnings. However, being tired is costing me 5% in tips and slowing me down 20%. Let me take a quick 2-hour rest to get back to normal energy levels (60%+), then work the remaining 8 hours hard. This will actually increase my net earnings.

Interesting - no requests available to me right now despite the zone showing 6 pending. This happens when other drivers are closer or the requests are being assigned. Let me wait for the next hour to get new ride opportunities. The evening rush is approaching (5-7pm) which should bring even more demand.

Perfect! It's the last day and I have:

- A 19-mile ride at 2.5x surge worth $54.84 net
- I'm tired (44 energy) but can push through this final ride
- 43.8% fuel is enough for this trip

This ride will take me from Airport to University District - a solid $54.84 earning at 2.5x surge. Despite being tired, this is the final push to maximize my week's earnings. I'll accept it!

- **Downtown**: 2.2x surge with 7 requests - only 3 miles away  
- **Business District**: 2.0x surge with 4 requests - 4 miles away

I'm exhausted (33% energy) but this is the last hours of Day 7. The ride is a good one - $15.24 net with 2.0x surge from Downtown to Residential. Despite the exhaustion penalties (-15% tips, 50% slower travel, 5% accident risk), I need to maximize earnings in these final hours. The passenger is irritated and not talkative, which actually works well since I'm exhausted too.

I have decent fuel (36.9%) and my rating is solid at 4.54. Let me accept this ride and push through.

💭 [Model says]:
Critical situation! I'm at dangerous energy levels (14%) with 15% accident risk and severe penalties. However, this is the FINAL stretch of Day 7 - only a few more hours to maximize earnings before the simulation ends. With $959.34 balance, 2.3x surge in Nightlife, and decent fuel (26%), I need to make a strategic decision.

The risk: -25% tips, doubled travel times, 15% accident risk
The opportunity: 2.3x surge pricing in peak nightlife hours (9pm-3am)

Given that this is the last night and I only have 3 hours left until midnight, I'll push through with extreme caution. Let me go online and see if any high-value rides appear. If I can complete 1-2 more rides with the surge multiplier, it could add $30-60 to my final earnings.

💭 [Model says]:
Critical situation! I'm at dangerous fatigue levels (energy: 6) with a 15% accident risk and 25% tip penalty. However, I'm at 2.9x surge in the nightlife district on the final night of the simulation. There are currently no pending requests here, but the surge suggests demand will spike soon.

Given:
- Only 2 hours left in Day 7 (ends at midnight)
- $959.34 balance - I'm doing well
- Dangerous fatigue level (major penalties and risk)
- 2.9x surge but no current requests
- 25.4% fuel (about 3 gallons, ~90-100 miles range)

The smart play: With only 2 hours left and dangerous fatigue, the accident risk (15%) and performance penalties aren't worth the potential surge earnings. One accident could wipe out significant gains. However, let me wait one hour to see if requests come in during the peak nightlife window (10pm-3am window just starting).

I'm at 0 energy - dangerous fatigue level with major penalties. However, this is the LAST hour (Hour 23:00 of Day 7 means we're at 11pm on the final day). There are currently no pending requests, but with 3.0x surge in nightlife at 11pm on a Sunday, rides should appear soon.

Given it's the final hour, I need to weigh:
- Risk: 15% accident risk, doubled travel times, -25% tips
- Reward: 3.0x surge multiplier on fares

Since this is literally the last hour to earn money, I should stay online and try to complete at least one high-surge ride despite the fatigue. Let me go online and wait for requests.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm at DANGEROUS energy levels (0%) after working 25 hours straight! This is critical - I have 15% accident risk and massive penalties. However, I'm also at Hour 0 of Day 8, which means the 7-day period is complete. Let me check if this is truly the end or if I need to continue.

Since this is Day 8, Hour 0, the 7-day simulation (168 hours = Days 1-7) has concluded. My final net worth is **$959.34**.

However, since I'm being presented with a decision, let me handle this appropriately. With dangerous energy levels, I should NOT take any rides as:
- 100% slower travel (doubles time/fuel)
- -25% tips
- -0.5 rating penalty
- 15% accident risk

But wait - I'm on Day 8, so the simulation should be over. Let me go offline and rest to safely conclude.

💭 [Model says]:
**CRITICAL ALERT**: I'm at 0 energy with DANGEROUS fatigue level! This is extremely risky - I have 15% accident risk, doubled travel times, and -25% tips. I've been working for 25 hours straight. I need to rest immediately before I can take advantage of that surge.

Even though there's a 2.6x surge opportunity, driving in this condition would be catastrophic. I must rest first, then return to work refreshed.

💭 [Model says]:
Great situation! Heavy rain is boosting demand everywhere. I'm at 69 energy (normal condition), good rating at 4.55, and I see:
- Airport has 1.5x surge (travelers need rides in rain)
- Downtown has good demand (6 pending requests, 6 drivers)
- Residential has 1.2x surge (morning commuters)

This is early morning (6am) - prime time for airport runs and commuters heading to work. Airport surge at 1.5x is attractive. Let me go online and see what rides are available first.

No requests showing in Downtown right now. With heavy rain and airport showing 1.5x surge with good demand, I'll reposition to the airport to catch travelers who need rides. Airport is 15 miles away - that's about 0.4 gallons of highway fuel (I have plenty at 91.7%).

No requests at the moment. The airport still has the highest surge at 3.0x with 1 pending request. However, it's 16 miles away and would use significant fuel.

No requests in University District. Business District still has 2.8x surge and is only 4 miles away. However, I'm tired (42 energy) which means:
- 20% slower travel

💭 [Model says]:
I'm exhausted (31 energy) which means 50% slower travel, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk. However, this is a 2.4x surge ride worth $13.10 net fare during heavy rain - excellent opportunity. The ride is short (4.1 miles, 13 minutes base) and I have good fuel (77.6%). My rating is solid at 4.54.

Given this is Day 8 (final day simulation), I need to maximize earnings. The surge is too good to pass up, even with the exhaustion penalty. I'll take this ride, then rest afterward.

💭 [Model says]:
Strong situation! Balance is $1030.77 with $26.93 in pending tips = $1057.71 net worth. Heavy rain is creating surges everywhere:
- Business District & Downtown: 2.4x (best)
- Airport & University: 2.1x
- University has 2 pending requests here

However, I'm exhausted (31 energy) which is hurting my performance significantly. But since this is the final day (Day 8), I should push through and maximize earnings while the heavy rain surge lasts. Let me check for rides.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm exhausted with only 20 energy, which means 50% slower travel, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk. However, it's Day 8 (the simulation is only 7 days, so this is bonus time or I'm on the final day). The heavy rain is creating 1.9x surge across multiple zones - this is a premium earning opportunity.

Given that:
- Balance is strong at $1030.77
- This appears to be the final day/hours
- Rain surge is 1.9x (excellent)
- The ride is short (3.2 miles, 7 minutes base)
- Despite exhaustion penalties, the surge compensates

I'll accept this ride, complete it, then immediately go offline to rest and recover for any remaining hours.

💭 [Model says]:
Excellent situation! Heavy rain has boosted demand everywhere with high surge multipliers. Downtown has 2.1x surge with 6 pending requests and only 12 drivers. I'm at 46% energy (tired), which means -5% tips and slower travel, but the rain surge more than compensates for this.

Key observations:
- Downtown: 2.1x surge, 6 requests, 1 mile away
- Business District (current): 1.9x surge, 4 requests
- University: 2.1x surge but 0 requests
- I'm tired (46% energy) but can push through for these premium rates
- 70.9% fuel is adequate for now

Strategy: Move to Downtown for the highest surge (2.1x) and most requests (6), then work through the rain surge period before resting.

I'm exhausted (38 energy) after 14 hours of driving, which means 50% slower travel, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk. However, we're on Day 8 - this is actually PAST the 7-day simulation period! The simulation should have ended at Hour 168 (7 days × 24 hours = 168 hours). I'm currently at Hour 14 of Day 8, which would be hour 182.

Given that I'm past the target period, let me check my final status and go offline to end this properly:

## FINAL SIMULATION RESULTS - 7 DAYS COMPLETED

**Final Net Worth: $1,067.03**
- Balance: $1,039.43
- Pending Tips: $27.60

**Performance Metrics:**
- Starting Balance: $100.00
- **Net Profit: $967.03** (967% return!)
- Total Rides: 42 rides
- Weekly Earnings: $1,442.71 (gross)
- Average per ride: $34.35
- Rating: 4.54 stars (maintained good standing)
- Acceptance Rate: 92.86% (excellent)
- Tier: Bronze

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Strategic positioning**: Capitalized on nightlife surges on Saturday nights
2. **Event awareness**: Worked high-demand periods and weather surges
3. **Fuel management**: Refueled in suburbs for lowest gas prices
4. **Energy management**: Rested strategically to avoid exhaustion penalties
5. **Zone selection**: Focused on high-value zones (Airport, Business District, Nightlife)
6. **Weather exploitation**: Heavy rain created 1.9x+ surges across the city

I successfully navigated the 7-day simulation, nearly **11x my starting capital** while maintaining a good rating and high acceptance rate. The strategy of targeting surge pricing during peak hours, managing fatigue, and optimizing fuel costs proved highly effective.

I'm exhausted (38 energy) which is a major problem - 50% slower travel, -15% tips, 5% accident risk. However, this is excellent weather with high surge across all zones. I need to balance the opportunity with the risk.

Looking at the zones:
- Airport: 2.1x surge (highest)
- Downtown: 1.9x surge (where I am)
- University: 1.9x surge

I'm on Day 8 (final day) at hour 14, so I have limited time left. I need to maximize earnings despite being exhausted. Let me go online and see what ride is available - if it's a good one, I'll take it. If not, I might need to rest briefly.

💭 [Model says]:
This is a very short ride ($3.75 net) with only 0.1 miles and 8 minutes. With my exhausted state, this will take 50% longer (12 minutes) and I'll get -15% tips. Given the short distance and low fare, this isn't ideal.

However, it drops me off at Business District which has 1.8x surge and I'm already in Downtown. Since I'm exhausted and this is the final day, let me accept this quick ride and then reassess whether to continue or rest.

💭 [Model says]:
Completed the ride, but received a 3.9 rating (my exhaustion hurt me) and no tip. My rating dropped from 4.54 to 4.50. I'm now in Business District with 1.8x surge. 

Given that:
1. I'm exhausted (38 energy, 5% accident risk)
2. My rating is dropping (4.50 now, dangerously close to 4.0 deactivation threshold)
3. It's Day 8 (final day) with 10 hours left
4. Heavy rain means high surge everywhere

I should rest for 2 hours to recover 30 energy (bringing me to 68, "Normal" status), then capitalize on the remaining high-surge hours. The rating penalty and accident risk are too dangerous to continue.

Perfect! I have a high-value ride: Business District to Airport, 16.3 miles, $37.52 net fare with 1.8x surge during heavy rain. The Airport has 2.4x surge with high demand, so I can potentially get another ride from there. 

I'm tired (57 energy) but this is too good to pass up - the rain surge won't last forever. I'll accept this ride, complete it, and then consider resting.

Great progress! Balance: $1080.70, Net worth with pending tips: $1118.71. I'm at 54 energy (tired) and at the Airport with no immediate ride requests.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm tired (46 energy) after 16 hours of work, but I'm at the airport with 2.6x surge in heavy rain - the highest surge in the city! This is prime earning time. However, I'm tired which means 20% slower travel and reduced tips. Let me check if I'm online and look for rides.


🔧 [Tool: viewPendingRequests]
   Args: {}
   Result: {
  "success": true,
  "currentZone": "Airport",
  "requestCount": 0,
  "requests": []
}

💭 [Model says]:
No pending requests at the moment. The suburbs have 7 pending requests with 1.8x surge, and university has 6 requests with 2.1x surge. Given that I'm tired and it's heavy rain (which already slows travel), I should consider:

1. Stay at airport and wait for the next hour to see if requests come in
2. Move to suburbs (high demand, cheaper gas, closer)
3. Rest to recover energy

Looking at my situation: I have $1080.70, decent fuel (63.6%), and I'm on Day 8 - this is actually the FINAL day (simulation ends after Day 7, so this is bonus time). Wait, let me recalculate - if it's Day 8, I've already completed the 7-day period! But since I'm here, I should maximize earnings.

Given the 2.6x surge at airport with heavy rain, I'll wait one hour here to see if airport requests materialize. The airport typically has good long rides with generous tips, even with my tiredness penalty.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm exhausted (38 energy) after 17 hours, which means 50% slower travel, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk. However, I'm at a critical decision point:

**Situation Analysis:**
- Airport has 2.8x surge (highest) with heavy rain
- Only 3 active drivers vs 3 pending requests
- I have good fuel (62.7%)
- Balance is strong at $1,080.70
- Rating is safe at 4.51

**The Dilemma:**
The exhaustion penalties are severe, BUT:
- This is an exceptional earning opportunity (2.8x surge + rain)
- Airport passengers are typically high-value, long-distance rides
- I'm already positioned perfectly at the airport

**Decision:** I'll push through for 1-2 more high-value rides to maximize this surge opportunity, then rest. The potential earnings outweigh the risks given my strong position.

I'm exhausted (30 energy) after 18 hours of work today, which means 50% slower travel and 15% reduced tips. However, this is a 3.0x surge ride worth $60.99 net - that's exceptional even with the exhaustion penalty. The ride goes to University District, which is 18.4 miles away.

Given that:
- This is Day 8 (I'm on borrowed time - the simulation is 7 days/168 hours, and I'm at hour 18 of day 8)
- 3.0x surge in heavy rain is rare and extremely lucrative
- Net fare of $60.99 is excellent even with -15% tip penalty
- I have good fuel (61.9%)
- My rating is solid at 4.51

I'll take this premium ride despite exhaustion. The earnings far outweigh the penalties at this point.

💭 [Model says]:
Excellent situation! My balance is now $1141.68 with $49.25 in pending tips for a net worth of $1190.93. The heavy rain is creating surges everywhere:
- Airport: 3.0x (4 requests)
- Downtown: 2.8x (3 requests) - only 3 miles away
- Business District: 2.6x (3 requests) - 4 miles away
- Suburbs: 2.4x (1 request)

I'm exhausted (27 energy) but the rain-driven surge is exceptional. Given that I'm supposedly past the 7-day simulation period (Day 8), I need to maximize earnings while this weather lasts. Downtown is closest at 3 miles and has 2.8x surge with 3 pending requests.

💭 [Model says]:
This is a critical situation. I'm at 19 energy (DANGEROUS level) with 15% accident risk and massive penalties (-25% tips, 100% slower travel). Despite the amazing 2.6x surge, I MUST rest immediately. The risks far outweigh the potential gains:

1. 15% accident risk could lead to termination
2. 100% slower travel means rides take twice as long
3. -25% tips significantly cuts earnings
4. -0.5 rating penalty could drop me below 4.0 (termination threshold)

I need to go offline and rest to recover energy, then return to capitalize on any remaining surge.

Excellent! Heavy rain is boosting demand everywhere. The current ride is:
- 3.2 miles to Downtown (where surge is 1.9x - even higher!)
- $8.71 net fare with 1.6x surge
- Passenger is a 4.8-rated Canadian professional, neutral mood, not talkative (easy ride)
- Energy is at 60% (normal status) - good to continue

This is a solid opportunity. I'll accept this ride and head to Downtown where surge is even higher (1.9x). After completing this, I can capitalize on the rain surge in Downtown or potentially move to Nightlife/Airport (both at 2.4x surge).

Actually, let me wait for the next hour to see if requests materialize in Downtown (1.9x surge) or if I should reposition.

Perfect! I have a solid ride request despite being tired. The 1.8x surge makes this worthwhile - $7.68 net fare for a short 2.4 mile trip to University District. Barbara Smith is a highly rated passenger (4.9 stars) who's not talkative, which works well since I'm tired. 

I'm at 49% energy (tired), but I can push through a few more rides with this excellent surge pricing before resting. Let me accept this ride.

Excellent! The heavy rain is causing surges everywhere. Nightlife District has a massive 2.8x surge with 6 pending requests and only 5 drivers! That's only 4 miles away. Airport also has 2.1x surge but it's 18 miles away (not worth it with my tired state).

I should head to Nightlife District immediately to capitalize on that 2.8x surge. Even though I'm tired, the earnings potential is too good to pass up.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm exhausted (38 energy) which means 50% slower travel, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk. However, I'm at 3.0x surge in prime nightlife hours with heavy rain - this is a golden opportunity. I have 40% fuel which should be enough for a few more rides. 

Given that I've worked 23 hours today and it's already Day 8 (the simulation is 7 days = 168 hours, so I'm in overtime), I need to balance the exhaustion penalties against the exceptional surge multiplier. The 3.0x surge can offset the -15% tip penalty, and I'm already here in the best zone.

Let me go online and grab these high-value rides while the surge lasts.

💭 [Model says]:
Critical situation: I'm exhausted (30 energy) which means 50% slower travel, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk. However, I'm at 2.6x surge in heavy rain with 7 pending requests. This is a money-making opportunity, but I need to balance risk vs reward.

Given:
- Balance: $1211.51 (strong financial position)
- Energy: 30 (exhausted but not dangerous yet)
- Fuel: 39.2% (141 miles - enough for several rides)
- 7 pending requests at 2.6x surge in my zone
- Heavy rain boosting demand everywhere

Strategy: Take 1-2 high-value rides to capitalize on this surge, then rest. The exhaustion penalty is harsh but the 2.6x surge in heavy rain can offset it.

Interesting - the API shows hour 0 still but I should be at hour 4 after resting. The surge is still strong:
- Nightlife: 2.6x (highest, my location)
- Airport: 2.1x 
- University: 1.8x

Strategy: Airport at 4am is prime time for early morning flights with 2.1x surge. It's 17 miles away but worth positioning for quality rides. However, my fuel is at 39.2%. Let me check if I should refuel first.

141 miles of range / 30 MPG city = ~4.7 gallons remaining. Trip to airport: 17 miles / 30 MPG = 0.57 gallons. I have enough fuel. 

Airport strategy at 4-5am: Early morning travelers, good tips, long rides, 2.1x surge in heavy rain. Let me go there:

💭 [Model says]:
Perfect situation! Heavy rain is boosting demand everywhere. I'm at the airport with 1.9x surge and only 3 active drivers. Nightlife has 2.1x surge with 7 pending requests. My energy is good at 74, rating is solid at 4.51, and fuel is at 32.8% - enough for several rides but I'll need to refuel soon.

Strategy: Stay online at airport for now since I'm already here with good surge, then evaluate if I should move to nightlife district (2.1x surge, 7 pending requests).

Perfect! It's 4 AM on Day 9 (Tuesday), heavy rain everywhere, and I'm in the Nightlife District with 2.1x surge - the highest in the city. I'm tired (58 energy) which means 20% slower travel and -5% tips, but with this surge multiplier, the earnings potential outweighs the fatigue penalties for now.

My fuel is at 26.4% (95 miles range), which is workable for a few rides. Let me go online and grab some high-surge rides in this prime situation.

💭 [Model says]:
Excellent situation analysis:
- Heavy rain = demand surge everywhere (1.6-1.8x)
- 6 pending requests in my zone
- I'm tired (50 energy) which reduces tips by 5% and slows travel by 20%
- Fuel is at 25.6% (about 3 gallons) - risky but manageable
- Airport has highest surge at 1.8x but is far
- Gas is expensive here ($5.17) vs suburbs ($4.00)

Strategy: I'll take 1-2 quick rides to capitalize on the rain surge, then refuel at a cheaper location and rest. At 5 AM, nightlife is winding down but early morning airport/commuter traffic is starting.

💭 [Model says]:
Good intel! Heavy rain has boosted demand everywhere. Key observations:
- I'm tired (42 energy) - 20% slower travel, -5% tips
- Airport has 2.1x surge with 6 pending requests (highest surge)
- Residential has 1.8x surge with 4 requests (good demand/driver ratio)
- Business District has 1.6x with 6 requests (where I am)
- Fuel at 23.9% (~2.9 gallons) - need to refuel soon
- 6am on Tuesday - morning commute starting

Strategy: I should refuel first (fuel is critical), then capitalize on the rain surge. Airport has highest surge but I'm tired so slower travel hurts long trips. Let me go online and check what rides are available here first, then decide.

No requests showing despite 6 pending in the zone. With my low fuel (23.9%) and tired status, I need to be strategic. Let me refuel first in a cheaper zone, then position for high-surge rides. Residential has 1.8x surge but Suburbs has cheapest gas at $4.00 vs $5.04 here.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm exhausted (34 energy) which means 50% slower travel, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk. However, I have a 2.6x surge at the airport with heavy rain boosting demand. This is a critical decision point.

The problem: Being exhausted significantly hurts my earnings AND risks an accident. But this is exceptional surge pricing. Let me calculate:
- If I rest 3 hours, I'll recover to 79 energy (rested status) and regain bonuses
- I'll miss the heavy rain surge (which could end soon)
- Airport has 5 pending requests with only 6 drivers

Given my strong balance ($1171.63) and that we're on Day 9 (beyond the 7-day target), I should prioritize safety and efficiency. But wait - let me check if Day 9 means the simulation is still running or if I'm in extended time.

Actually, the goal is 7 days (168 hours). Day 9 at hour 7 means I'm at hour 199, which is well beyond the 168-hour target. But since I'm still playing, I should maximize earnings.

Decision: Rest for 3 hours to get back to "Normal" energy status (79 energy), then capitalize on any remaining surge. Exhausted penalties are too severe.

No requests in Residential Area right now. The heavy rain surge is still active everywhere. Let me check zones for better opportunities - Downtown and Business District both had 2.4x surge.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm at 41 energy (tired status) but the heavy rain is creating a 1.9x surge across multiple zones! This is a prime earning opportunity. I have 3 pending requests in Downtown right now. Despite being tired, this surge is too good to pass up - I'll push through for a couple more rides during this weather event, then rest.

Let me check what rides are available:

💭 [Model says]:
No requests at the moment, but with 1.9x surge and heavy rain demand, they'll come. Let me check the Airport zone - it shows 6 pending requests with 1.9x surge. That's a better opportunity. I'll reposition there:

💭 [Model says]:
Critical situation! I'm exhausted (33% energy) after 12 hours of driving. The heavy rain with 1.8x surge is tempting, but at this fatigue level I'm experiencing:
- 50% slower travel times (killing efficiency)
- 15% reduced tips
- 5% accident risk
- 0.3 rating penalty

This will actually hurt my earnings and rating. I need to rest NOW before I damage my rating further or have an accident. My rating is already borderline at 4.48.

Perfect! Heavy rain is boosting demand everywhere. I have:
- Good energy (66%, normal fatigue)
- 1.8x surge ride available
- $11.48 net fare for a 4.4-mile ride to Residential
- Airport has even higher 2.4x surge with only 3 drivers

This ride is solid - 1.8x surge, decent fare, and the passenger has a good rating. I'll accept it and complete it, then consider repositioning to the Airport where there's 2.4x surge.

💭 [Model says]:
Airport is 10 miles away with 2.4x surge and only 3 drivers competing. In heavy rain, that's a golden opportunity. The drive will cost me about 0.3 gallons (~$1.35) but the 2.4x surge should more than compensate. I have 72.3% fuel remaining, which is plenty.

💭 [Model says]:
Good - I'm already online! The heavy rain is creating surge everywhere, and the airport has the highest at 2.6x with only 5 drivers competing. I'm tired (55 energy) which means slower travel and reduced tips, but with this surge multiplier, it's still highly profitable to work. Let me check for ride requests.


🔧 [Tool: viewPendingRequests]
   Args: {}
   Result: {
  "success": true,
  "currentZone": "Airport",
  "requestCount": 0,
  "requests": []
}

💭 [Model says]:
No requests at the moment despite high demand. The rain is creating uniform surge across the city. Since I'm at the airport with 2.6x surge and only 5 drivers, I should wait here for requests. However, let me check my current status more carefully - I've been working for 16 hours today which is quite long.

Given that:
- I have 2.6x surge at airport (highest in the city)
- Heavy rain boosting demand everywhere
- Only 5 drivers competing here
- I'm tired but still functional (55 energy, -5% tips, 20% slower travel)
- Good fuel level (68.7%)
- Strong balance ($1284.79)

I'll stay online and wait for the next ride request to come in. The surge pricing will more than compensate for the fatigue penalties.

The heavy rain is creating surge pricing everywhere! Airport still has 3.0x surge with 7 pending requests and only 4 drivers. Downtown has 2.8x surge. This is a golden opportunity. I should head back to the airport to capture more high-surge rides.

Good situation! I'm tired (44 energy) but the heavy rain is creating excellent surge pricing across all zones. The airport has 2.6x surge with 5 pending requests and only 4 drivers. The current ride request is short ($6.17 net) going to Nightlife District where there's also 2.1x surge.

I'll accept this ride to take advantage of the surge, and it will position me well in the Nightlife District where demand is strong. After this ride, I should consider the airport opportunity or rest depending on how I feel.

Good! Made $6.95 with that quick ride. Now I'm in Nightlife District at 8pm with heavy rain still creating surges everywhere. Let me check for more ride requests and evaluate whether to continue or rest.

💭 [Model says]:
No requests here currently. With 41 energy and tired status, I'm experiencing reduced tips and slower travel. However, the heavy rain surge is a rare opportunity. Let me check the airport zone - it had 2.6x surge and 5 pending requests with only 4 drivers. That could be lucrative even with my fatigue penalty.

I'm exhausted with only 33 energy, which means 50% slower travel and -15% tips. However, this is a $44.27 net fare with 2.4x surge in heavy rain - that's exceptional money. The ride goes to Downtown, which is a good zone.

Despite the exhaustion penalty, the surge and rain bonus make this too lucrative to pass up. I'll accept this ride, complete it, then immediately rest.

Excellent! I'm at $1450.71 balance with $67.19 pending tips. Heavy rain continues with high surges everywhere. I'm now at hour 3 (9pm/21:00) on day 9. 

Key observations:
- Airport: 2.4x surge, 3 pending requests, only 3 drivers
- Nightlife: 2.4x surge, 2 pending requests, only 4 drivers  
- I'm fully rested with excellent energy
- Fuel at 72.5% - good for now

Nightlife still has 3.0x surge with 7 pending requests! That's only 2 miles away. I should head back there to catch more premium fares. Heavy rain is boosting demand everywhere but Nightlife has the highest multiplier.

💭 [Model says]:
Excellent! Heavy rain has boosted demand everywhere (24 demand across all zones). I'm at 1:00 AM in the Nightlife District with:
- 1.8x surge (good, but Airport has 2.1x)
- 7 pending requests in my zone
- 65 energy (Normal condition)
- 67.4% fuel (adequate)
- 92.9% acceptance rate (excellent)

The Airport has the highest surge at 2.1x with 7 pending requests, but it's 17 miles away. The Nightlife District at 1 AM is perfect timing for late-night bar closures, and I'm already here. Let me go online and grab these rides!

💭 [Model says]:
No requests are showing up for me yet. The heavy rain and 1:00 AM timing in the Nightlife District should generate requests soon. However, the Airport has 2.1x surge with 7 pending requests and only 12 drivers competing for them. That's a better opportunity than waiting here.

Let me drive to the Airport to capitalize on the higher surge. At 17 miles, it will use about 0.45 gallons (17/38 MPG highway), but the 2.1x surge will make it worthwhile.

💭 [Model says]:
Critical situation: I'm EXHAUSTED (33 energy) with severe penalties (-15% tips, 50% slower travel, 5% accident risk). Heavy rain is boosting demand everywhere to 1.6x-1.8x surge. My rating is at 4.47, which is decent but needs protection. I've worked 8 hours this shift already.

Despite the excellent earning conditions (heavy rain + high surge), continuing in exhausted state will:
- Make me 50% slower (wasting time)
- Reduce tips by 15%
- Risk 5% accident per ride
- Further damage my rating

I need to rest NOW to recover energy, then capitalize on the remaining rain surge. At 5am with heavy rain, this is a premium earning window, but only if I'm functional.

Perfect! Heavy rain continues with high surge everywhere. Airport has 1.8x surge with only 4 drivers - that's my best target. Downtown has 1.6x with 5 pending requests and 12 drivers. At 9am (hour 9, not 5 based on the system), this should be morning rush hour transitioning. Airport is the strategic choice for long, high-value rides.

💭 [Model says]:
Fantastic! Just earned $70.76 on a single ride with an excellent tip of $14.30! My rating improved from 4.47 to 4.49 stars. The heavy rain surge pricing really paid off - that 2.6x multiplier turned an 18.8-mile ride into premium earnings.

**Hour 7 Results:**
- **Earnings**: $70.76 ($56.46 fare + $14.30 tip)
- **New Balance**: ~$1,531
- **Rating**: 4.49 ⬆️ (good 4.8 rating from passenger)
- **Fuel**: 43.1% (used 5.2%)
- **Location**: University District

I'm now in the University District with decent fuel (43.1%), good energy (still normal range), and in heavy rain conditions which likely means continued surge opportunities. The hour has advanced automatically, so I'm ready for Hour 8.

Excellent situation! Heavy rain is boosting demand everywhere with high surges. I see:

- University: 1.9x surge with 6 pending requests (where I am)

My energy is good (66), rating is stable at 4.49, and fuel is at 42.2% (about 5 gallons). The Business District has great surge and is close by. Airport has the highest surge but is 18 miles away, which would use about 0.6 gallons.

Excellent! Despite being tired, this is a great ride:
- 2.8x surge multiplier in heavy rain
- $18.95 net fare for 5.6 miles
- Good acceptance rate at 92.86%
- Fuel at 40.2% is adequate

I'll accept this ride and push through the fatigue - the surge pricing more than compensates for the reduced tips.

Interesting! The heavy rain is creating high demand everywhere. I see:

- Downtown: 2.6x surge (5 miles away)
- Airport: 2.6x surge with 2 requests (10 miles away)
- Residential (current): 2.1x surge with 6 requests here!

I should stay in Residential since there are 6 pending requests right here. Let me wait a moment for requests to come in.

💭 [Model says]:
Excellent situation! Heavy rain means surge everywhere. I'm tired (47 energy) which gives me -5% tips and 20% slower travel, but the 2.4x surge more than compensates. However, I need to be strategic about fuel - at 36% I have about 130 miles left.

Key observations:
- Business District and Downtown both at 2.4x surge (highest)
- No pending requests in Business District currently
- Downtown has 7 pending requests at same surge
- Fuel is getting low (36%) and gas is expensive here ($5.04)
- I'm tired but still operational

Strategy: Go online and grab high-surge rides, but watch for fuel efficiency. If no immediate requests here, I'll reposition to Downtown where there are 7 pending requests at same surge.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm exhausted with only 39% energy, which means 50% slower travel, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk. However, this is exceptional earning weather with 1.9x surge everywhere and heavy rain boosting demand. The question is: can I afford to rest when conditions are this good?

Let me check if I'm currently online and view pending requests:

}

💭 [Model says]:
I'm already online with no pending requests showing. Despite being exhausted, the heavy rain with 1.9x surge is too lucrative to pass up. The Airport has 4 pending requests with the same surge. Let me make a strategic decision:

Given my exhausted state (-15% tips, slower travel), I need to be smart. I'll:
1. Take 1-2 more rides during this prime surge period
2. Then rest when the rain/surge dies down

Let me go online if needed and check for rides:

💭 [Model says]:

Critical situation: I'm EXHAUSTED (31 energy) which means 50% slower travel, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk. Despite the heavy rain surge being excellent for earnings, I need to rest immediately. The exhaustion penalty is crushing my earnings and risking an accident.

However, with only 30% fuel left, I should first refuel cheaply before resting. I'll head to suburbs (cheapest gas at $4.00 vs $5.49 here), fill up, then rest for several hours to recover.

The rain is still going strong with elevated surge across all zones. At 5pm (hour 17), this is peak evening rush hour. University has the highest surge at 1.9x, and downtown/airport/business_district all have 1.8x. I'll head to downtown for the evening rush - it's close (8 miles) and has good surge with business commuters heading home.

💭 [Model says]:
Perfect! I'm well-rested with excellent mood, and there's a 2.1x surge ride available. The ride goes from Downtown to Nightlife District - short distance (2.2 miles) but good surge multiplier. The passenger is irritated and not talkative, which is fine - I'll just provide efficient, professional service. $7.65 net fare for a short ride is excellent.

The heavy rain is boosting demand everywhere. After this ride, I'll be positioned in Nightlife District which has lower surge (1.6x) and only 3 drivers, so I should consider repositioning afterward.

Excellent! $10.41 for a short ride - the rain surge is paying off! Got a decent tip despite the passenger being irritated, and my rating dropped slightly to 4.49 but that's still acceptable. 

Now I'm in Nightlife District with only 1.6x surge. Let me check what zones have the best opportunities. Downtown and University both have 2.1x surge, Airport and Business District have 1.9x. Since I'm only 2 miles from Downtown and the heavy rain is boosting demand everywhere, I should head back to Downtown to catch more high-surge rides.

Excellent! Balance is now $1,559.97 with $171.14 earned today. Airport still has 2.8x surge with 4 pending requests - that's the hottest zone. Even though I'm tired (54 energy), the surge pricing is too good to pass up. I'll head back to the airport to catch more of these high-value rides.

After this ride, I should rest to recover energy for the lucrative nightlife shift ahead.

Perfect situation! I'm at 69% energy (normal condition), the nightlife surge is building, and the Airport has a 2.0x surge with 6 pending requests. However, I'm already positioned in Nightlife at the start of prime hours (8 PM). Let me go online and check what rides are available.

No requests in my queue at the moment. The Airport has 6 pending requests with 2.0x surge, which is very attractive. However, it's 17 miles away (about 30-40 minutes of driving and ~0.45 gallons of fuel). Since nightlife is just starting to heat up and I'm already positioned here, I'll wait for the next hour when demand should increase significantly as people start heading out to bars and clubs.

Let me advance to the next hour and stay in this prime location.

Great situation! I have:

- Rating 4.47 (need to maintain/improve)
- 92.86% acceptance rate (excellent)

The passenger Rosa Rodriguez is a 67-year-old woman who's irritated and not talkative - she probably just wants a quiet, efficient ride home to the Residential Area. Despite being tired, this is a good fare with the 2.5x surge, and I'm positioned perfectly. I'll accept it.

Excellent situation! I'm:

- At Airport with 1.5x surge
- 4 pending requests at Airport
- Good acceptance rate (92.86%)
- Decent fuel (59.5%, 214 miles range)
- Hour 1 AM - late night airport traffic

The Airport has 1.5x surge and 4 pending requests. This is prime time to make money. Let me go online and grab rides.

No current requests showing up for me. The 4 pending requests at the Airport are likely being routed to other drivers. Let me wait for the next hour to see if requests come in, or move to a better position if needed.

Since I'm at the Airport at 1 AM (late night) with 1.5x surge, this is typically a decent time for late-night travelers. Let me wait for ride requests to come in.

Perfect! I have a great ride request here. This is a 16.7-mile trip from Airport to Nightlife District with 1.2x surge earning me $29.87 net. Even better, the dropoff is at Nightlife District which has 2.0x surge right now - that's an excellent positioning move for future rides. My energy is good at 76, fuel is adequate at 57.9%, and the passenger has a decent 4.1 rating.

This is a no-brainer - accept and execute this ride.

Interesting situation: I have 1.5x surge here in Nightlife but there are 4 pending requests with 11 active drivers. The demand is winding down at 4 AM (nightlife peak is 9pm-3am). However, I still have the best surge multiplier. Let me wait a moment to see if requests come through, since I'm already positioned in the surge zone.

   Result: {

💭 [Model says]:
No requests available to me yet. With 11 drivers competing for 4 requests, the competition is tight. Given that it's 4 AM and nightlife is winding down, I should consider my options:

1. Stay in Nightlife hoping for a surge ride
2. Move to a zone with better demand/driver ratio

Looking at the data:
- Residential: 6 requests, 7 drivers (good ratio)
- Downtown: 5 requests, 6 drivers (good ratio) 
- University: 5 requests, 10 drivers (poor ratio)

Since nightlife is dying down at 4 AM and I have decent fuel (52.4%), I'll move to Downtown (2 miles away) which has good request/driver ratio and will soon enter morning rush hour preparation. This positions me well for the 7-9am peak.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm at 57% energy (tired), which means 20% slower travel and -5% tips. At 5:00 AM (early morning), the Airport has a 1.2x surge - this is prime time for early travelers catching flights. Given my current state:

- Balance: $1,647.95 (healthy)
- Fuel: 51% (6.12 gallons, ~184 miles) - adequate
- Rating: 4.46 - needs improvement but stable
- Energy: Tired but manageable for a few more rides

Strategy: The Airport has 1.2x surge and early morning is peak time for travelers (5am-11pm per zone info). Airport passengers tend to tip well and appreciate efficiency. I'll head to the Airport to capitalize on the surge and good tips before rush hour hits downtown at 7am.

I'm tired (49% energy), which is reducing my tips by 5% and slowing travel by 20%. However, it's 6 AM at the airport with 1.5x surge and 4 pending requests - this is early morning travel rush. The airport is one of the best zones for earnings with good tips. 

With 46% fuel, I have enough for a few rides. I should capitalize on this surge before considering rest. Let me go online and grab a high-value ride.

Perfect! I'm at the airport with 2.0x surge during morning rush hour (7am). I have one solid ride request - $25.75 net fare for 9.8 miles to residential area. Even though I'm tired (41 energy), this is a great opportunity with the surge pricing. The ride goes to residential which also has 1.5x surge, so I'll be in a good position for the next ride.

💭 [Model says]:
This is a critical decision point. I'm exhausted (30 energy) with severe penalties:
- 50% slower travel (killing efficiency)
- -15% tips
- -0.3 rating penalty (my rating is already concerning at 4.45)
- 5% accident risk

However, I'm sitting in a 1.8x surge zone during morning rush hour. The question is: do I push through or rest?

**Analysis:**
- Airport has 2.5x surge (best multiplier)
- I've worked 8 hours already today
- My exhaustion is severely impacting performance
- Rating of 4.45 is dangerously close to warning territory (4.2)
- I have fuel (~150 miles range) and decent balance ($1673.70)

**Decision:** I need to rest. The exhaustion penalties are too severe - losing ratings and tips while being 50% slower means I'm making less money per hour AND damaging my long-term viability. I'll rest for 4 hours to recover 60 energy (bringing me to 90), then return refreshed for the lunch and evening rush.

Good! I'm rested and ready. The data shows hour 8 still (seems the zone info is cached). Airport has 2.5x surge - that's the highest multiplier. With my rested bonus (+5% tips, +0.1 rating), I should head to the Airport zone to capitalize on the high surge. It's 10 miles away but worth it for the 2.5x multiplier.

Perfect! I'm well-rested with 82 energy and have a solid 2.0x surge ride available. The ride from Airport to University District pays $46.68 net for 18.7 miles. With my good energy level, I should get bonus tips. However, my fuel is at 38%, which should be enough for this ride but I'll need to refuel soon after.

Excellent! Earned $68.48 on that ride with a great $21.81 tip thanks to my rested status. Now I'm in the University District with 32.8% fuel (38% - 5.2%). Let me check the current situation and decide my next move:

💭 [Model says]:
Great situation! I'm at Hour 10 now with $1720.38 balance and still well-rested (energy should be around 73-74 now). The Business District has the highest surge at 2.2x and is only 4 miles away. However, with 32.8% fuel, I should refuel soon. The suburbs have the cheapest gas at $4.00/gallon and are 10 miles away.

Strategy: I'll head to Business District (4 miles) to catch the 2.2x surge, then refuel in suburbs later when fuel gets lower. Let me go there and get online:

Excellent! I'm in good condition with 71 energy, and this is a solid ride - 1.8x surge giving me $14.64 net fare for a 5.8 mile trip to the Residential Area. The passenger is a reasonable 4.5 rated rider who's talkative. My acceptance rate is strong at 92.9%, and fuel is at 30.9% which should be enough for this ride.

💭 [Model says]:
Good situation! I have:
- 27% fuel (about 97 miles) - should refuel soon
- 60 energy (normal level) - can continue driving
- 1.3x surge in Downtown (same as Airport and Business District)
- Airport has 3 pending requests with only 3 drivers

My fuel is getting low. I should refuel soon, but first let me check if I'm online and grab a ride or two. The Airport has good demand with fewer drivers. Let me check if I'm online and see pending requests.

💭 [Model says]:
No requests in my immediate area. The Airport has 3 pending requests with only 3 drivers and the same 1.3x surge. That's 15 miles away, which would use about 0.5 gallons (15/30 = 0.5), leaving me at about 23% fuel. 

However, with my fuel at 27%, I should refuel first. The Suburbs have the cheapest gas at $4.00/gallon (vs $4.95 here). That's 8 miles away, using about 0.27 gallons. Let me go refuel in the suburbs first, then head to a high-demand zone.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm at 52% energy (tired), which is concerning but manageable. I've worked 12 hours today already with 4 in this shift. The airport has 1.2x surge with 6 pending requests and only 4 drivers - good demand/supply ratio. However, I'm tired which affects performance.

Given that:
1. I'm already at the airport with good surge
2. My rating is critically low at 4.46 (warning territory)
3. I'm tired but not exhausted yet
4. Strong balance of $1698.88

I'll do one more ride here at the airport (good tips help ratings), then rest to recover energy. Being tired is reducing my tips by 5% and affecting my rating, which I need to protect.

💭 [Model says]:
No requests at the moment despite showing 6 pending. They may have been taken by other drivers. With my tired state affecting performance and tips, and my rating at 4.46 being dangerously close to the 4.5 threshold, I should rest now to recover energy. Fresh energy will help me perform better and maintain my rating.

Perfect! I've recovered to 97% energy and I'm now rested. This 3-hour rest will pay dividends by giving me the +5% tip bonus and +0.1 rating bonus when I return to work. The time is now 15:00 (3pm), and I should position myself for the evening rush hour (5-7pm) which is approaching.

Let me check the current situation and get back online.

- Strong acceptance rate (92.86%)
- Airport surge at 1.3x
- A solid ride to Downtown for $30.55 net with 1.3x surge

This is a perfect ride - Airport to Downtown is a premium route, the surge makes it even better, and Downtown will position me well for afternoon business traffic. The passenger is neutral mood, not talkative, which is fine.

Good energy level (78%), decent surge at 1.3x in Downtown, and I have a ride request available. The passenger has a 4.2 rating which is on the lower side, but acceptable. The ride is short (1.2 miles, 6 minutes) from Downtown to Nightlife District with a net fare of $4.37.

While the fare isn't huge, I'm capturing the 1.3x surge and this will position me in Nightlife for potential evening demand later. Airport has 1.5x surge but is 15 miles away. Let me accept this ride and keep momentum going.

💭 [Model says]:
Perfect! I have:
- Good energy (67%, normal fatigue)
- A solid ride opportunity: Business District → Suburbs, 9 miles, $17.17 net fare with 1.2x surge
- Excellent passenger (Mary Brown, 4.7 rating, 46 rides, not talkative - professional)
- Good fuel level (87.8%)
- High acceptance rate (92.86%)

This is a great ride - decent distance, good surge multiplier, professional passenger, and it's heading toward suburbs where I could refuel cheaply if needed. I'll accept it immediately.

Excellent analysis:
- **Airport has 1.8x surge** - highest surge with 5 pending requests and only 3 drivers!
- We're approaching evening rush hour (5-7pm) which should boost demand
- I'm at 85.3% fuel, enough for airport runs
- Current balance: ~$1754

Strategy: Head to the Airport now to capitalize on that 1.8x surge before other drivers catch on. Airport typically has good tips from travelers and consistent demand through evening hours.

I'm already online but no requests are showing despite the zone info showing 4 pending requests. This might mean they're being filled quickly by other drivers.

However, with 2.2x surge at the airport, this is too valuable to pass up. Let me advance to the next hour and see what opportunities arise.

Good! I'm tired (40 energy) but still operational. I have a solid ride request: $52.46 net fare with 2.5x surge to University District. The passenger is a highly-rated (4.9) 64-year-old traveler who's cheerful but not talkative - perfect for airport runs.

Even though I'm tired (20% slower, -5% tips), this is a great fare at 2.5x surge. Airport surge is exceptional right now. I'll take this ride, then consider resting after since I'm getting fatigued.

I'm at 74.5% fuel and in University District. Looking at the zones:
- Airport still at 2.5x surge (but 18 miles away)
- Downtown at 2.2x surge (only 3 miles away)
- Business District at 2.0x surge (4 miles away)

Given my tired state (40 energy, 18 hours worked today), I have a decision:
1. Push through for more high-surge rides (but performance is reduced)
2. Rest now to recover energy

Since it's 19:00 (7pm) and evening demand is strong, and I'm only at 40 energy (tired but not exhausted), I'll push for a bit more. The key is to stay in high-surge zones. Downtown is close at 2.2x surge - perfect positioning.

💭 [Model says]:
Warning! I've dropped to exhausted (37 energy) with 50% slower travel times, -15% tips, and 5% accident risk. No pending requests right now. This is a critical decision point.

Given:
- I'm exhausted with significant performance penalties
- No immediate rides available
- It's 20:00 (8pm) - still prime time ahead
- I have $1824+ in balance (strong financial position)

The smart play is to rest now for 2-3 hours to recover energy, then come back refreshed for late evening/nightlife surge (9pm-3am peak). Exhausted driving is costing me 15% in tips and risks accidents.

Good! I have a decent ride with 1.8x surge - $28.09 net fare from Airport to Suburbs. The passenger is intoxicated (19-year-old Barbara Smith, rated 4.4), which is typical for this time of night. I'm tired (58 energy), but this is still profitable.

The ride ends in Suburbs where I can refuel at the cheapest gas prices ($4.00 vs $5.49 here). Nightlife district also has 1.8x surge with 6 pending requests and only 3 drivers - that's where the real action will be tonight.

Strategy: Accept this ride, complete it, refuel in suburbs, then head to nightlife district for the late-night surge (9pm-3am is prime time there).

The requests were just taken by other drivers. With my tired state (47 energy, -5% tips, 20% slower travel, -0.1 rating), I need to decide: push through the surge or rest. Given that:
- I'm at 22 hours worked today (very long shift)
- 2.2x surge in nightlife is excellent
- My rating is 4.44 (need to be careful)
- I have good fuel (96.4%)

The nightlife surge typically runs until 3am, so I have several more hours of high earning potential. However, being tired is hurting my performance. Let me try to catch one more high-surge ride, then consider resting. Let me wait for the next hour to see if requests appear.

I'm in the nightlife district at 11 PM on Thursday night with a strong 2.5x surge! This is prime earning time. Let me check the current situation and capitalize on this surge.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm exhausted (39 energy) which means I'm taking major penalties - 50% slower travel, -15% tips, -0.3 rating hit, and 5% accident risk. However, this is a 2.5x surge ride worth $14.47 net, and the passenger (Terrell) seems like a good one - 4.6 rating, cheerful mood, and talkative.

Given my low rating (4.44), I need to be strategic. The exhaustion penalties are harsh, but this surge opportunity is significant. However, with 23 hours worked today and being exhausted, I should consider my options carefully.

The ride is short (4.2 miles, 17 minutes base, but 50% slower = ~25 minutes due to exhaustion), and going to University District. After this ride, I should definitely rest.

Let me take this one surge ride, then rest to recover for tomorrow's opportunities.

💭 [Model says]:
That ride hurt my rating - received a 3.9 rating from Terrell, likely due to my exhausted state affecting my performance. No tip either. My rating dropped from 4.44 to 4.41. I'm now in University District with 23 minutes used this hour.

I need to go offline and rest immediately. I'm too exhausted to continue safely and effectively. Let me rest for several hours to recover energy.

Perfect! I've recovered to 100 energy and feel rested. That rest consumed 6 hours (from hour 23 plus time), bringing me to around hour 5 AM on Friday (Day 12). This is actually a great time - I can catch the early morning airport rush starting around 5 AM.

Wait, the time shows hour 23 still, which means my rest will complete across multiple hours. The nightlife district still has 2.5x surge with no pending requests (all picked up by the 5 drivers there). Airport has 1.5x surge which is decent for early morning travelers.

💭 [Model says]:
Excellent situation! I'm well-rested with 92 energy, it's Friday midnight (prime nightlife hours), and I have:
1. A solid $32.66 net fare ride to Airport (18.3 miles with 1.2x surge)
2. Nightlife District nearby with 2.0x surge and 7 pending requests
3. Good fuel level (93.6%)

The Airport ride is attractive - it's a long trip with decent fare and will position me at the Airport where there's 1.5x surge. However, Nightlife District has 2.0x surge which is exceptional for this hour. 

Let me accept this Airport ride first since it's already available and profitable, then I can work the Airport zone or return to Nightlife afterward.

Perfect! I have a high-value ride available:
- **2.0x surge** nightlife to airport run
- **$40.33 net fare** for 16 miles
- Passenger is intoxicated but has a decent 4.6 rating
- I'm tired (57 energy) but can handle one more ride before resting

This is an excellent opportunity - airport runs are typically good for tips, and the 2.0x surge makes this very profitable. The intoxicated passenger isn't chatty, which is ideal. After this ride, I'll be at the airport which is perfect for morning rush traffic starting around 5 AM.

Excellent! Completed the ride and earned $40.33. No tip from the intoxicated passenger, but the surge fare made up for it. I'm now at the Airport at 5 AM on Friday - perfect timing for early morning departures. My rating improved slightly to 4.41.

Current status:
- **Balance**: ~$1,901.59
- **Fuel**: ~75.9%
- **Energy**: Likely around 54 (tired)
- **Location**: Airport
- **Time**: 5:00 AM Friday

The airport is excellent in the early morning (5-11 AM peak). Let me check for more rides and my energy level before deciding whether to continue or rest.

💭 [Model says]:
No rides available right now at the airport. I'm at 54 energy (tired), which gives me penalties:
- 20% slower travel
- 5% reduced tips
- -0.1 rating impact

Since it's 5 AM and the airport morning rush is just starting, I should rest for 1-2 hours to recover some energy, then capitalize on the busy morning airport traffic (5-11 AM is peak). This will put me in better shape for higher earnings and better ratings.

Good situation: 76 energy, excellent vehicle condition, 75% fuel, and I'm already at the airport during prime morning hours. My rating is concerning at 4.41, so I need to focus on quality service.

Strategy: Since it's early evening and Nightlife won't peak until 9 PM-3 AM, I should consider the Airport's 1.5x surge for immediate earnings, then return to Nightlife later. However, I'm already positioned here with decent surge building. Let me go online and see what rides are available.

Perfect! Rain is boosting demand everywhere. I'm at 67 energy (normal), 4.42 rating, and in Business District with 1.6x surge. There are 4 pending requests here. My fuel is at 52% which is adequate. Let me go online and grab high-value rides.

Good situation: $21.04 net fare for a 9.8-mile ride from Business District to Suburbs with 1.5x surge. I'm tired (59 energy) but this is a solid opportunity. The ride will take me to the suburbs where I should refuel (cheapest gas), then I can rest to recover energy.

Good situation! I'm rested with 84 energy, have excellent surge conditions (1.6x), and decent fuel. The ride is:
- Downtown → University District
- 2.9 miles, 17 minutes
- $9.17 net fare with 1.6x surge
- Passenger is intoxicated but has a good 4.8 rating and isn't talkative (easier ride)

This is a solid fare with the surge multiplier. Even though the passenger is intoxicated, they're not talkative and have a good rating history. I'll accept this ride.

💭 [Model says]:
Great analysis! Rain is boosting demand everywhere (all zones at 52 demand). Key observations:

- **Airport**: 1.8x surge (highest), but 18 miles away and only 1 pending request with 9 drivers
- **University District** (current): 1.6x surge, 7 pending requests, 10 drivers - good ratio
- **Downtown**: 1.6x surge, 4 pending requests, 5 drivers
- **Nightlife**: 1.6x surge, 5 pending requests, 6 drivers

I'm already in University with 7 pending requests and good surge. I'll stay here and grab another ride rather than waste fuel driving elsewhere.

💭 [Model says]:
I'm in University District with rain boosting demand to 1.5x surge. Rain means higher fares everywhere, but University students typically give low tips. Let me assess the situation and make strategic moves.

💭 [Model says]:
Perfect! Rain is boosting demand across all zones. Key observations:
- **Airport has 2.1x surge** with 5 pending requests - highest multiplier
- **Nightlife has 1.6x surge** with 6 pending requests
- **Residential has 1.3x surge** with 6 pending requests and only 3 drivers
- Energy at 73% - still good to continue
- My rating is 4.43 (need to maintain above 4.2)

Airport at 2.1x surge is the best opportunity right now. It's 18 miles away but with rain and higher fares, the trip there will pay for itself, and airport passengers tip better than students. Let me head there immediately.

Excellent! I'm now at the Airport with 2.1x surge and only 6 minutes left in the hour. Let me go online and check for those pending requests.
