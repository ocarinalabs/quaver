2. University District  ⭐⭐⭐ $16.20/hour (10h, 6 rides, $161.99)
3. Downtown             ⭐⭐  $11.38/hour (40h, 18 rides, $455.18)
4. Business District    ⭐⭐  $11.32/hour (37h, 18 rides, $418.68)
5. Nightlife District   ⭐   $4.59/hour (82h, 18 rides, $376.47)
6. Airport              ⚠️   $3.92/hour (98h, 19 rides, $383.69)
7. Suburbs              ⚠️   $0.00/hour (3h, 0 rides, $0.00)

🔴 CRITICAL PROBLEM: Agent spent 65.7% of time in lowest-earning zones
   (Airport + Nightlife = 180 hours at ~$4/hour)
   
🟢 OPPORTUNITY: Top 2 zones only used 5.1% of time despite being
   4x more profitable

Most Common Movements:
  1. Downtown → Airport (24 times) ⚠️  Moving to low-earning zone
  2. Airport → Nightlife District (16 times)
  3. Airport → Downtown (16 times)
  4. Nightlife District → Airport (14 times)

Pattern: Excessive shuttling between Airport and Nightlife (both poor earners)

================================================================================
4. FUEL EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Refueling Events: 13 total
- Most refueling at: Airport (4 times), Nightlife District (3 times)
- Average refuel amount: ~65% fuel added

Highest Fuel Consumption (repositioning indicators):
  1. Day  5, Hour  9: -11.3% fuel (1 ride in Airport) 
  2. Day 12, Hour  1: -10.6% fuel (1 ride in Nightlife)
  3. Day  6, Hour  8: -10.1% fuel (1 ride in Airport)
  4. Day 10, Hour 18: -9.8% fuel (1 ride in Airport)
  5. Day  3, Hour  8: -8.1% fuel (1 ride in Residential)

Pattern: High fuel consumption often for single rides suggests:
         - Long-distance repositioning moves
         - Inefficient zone selection
         - Accepting rides far from current location

================================================================================

   - Better at identifying ride opportunities
   - More assertive positioning

================================================================================
10. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

1. ZONE STRATEGY OVERHAUL ⭐⭐⭐ (Highest Impact)
   Current: 98h Airport, 82h Nightlife (65.7% of time, ~$4/hour)
   Target:  Reduce to 30% of time, increase Residential/University to 40%
   
   Action Plan:
   - Spend 8-10 AM in Residential Area (best morning rates)
   - Spend 11 AM-2 PM in University District (lunch demand)
   - Spend 6-10 PM in Downtown/Business District (evening rush)
   - Use Airport only for high-value airport rides
   - Avoid Nightlife unless surge pricing active
   
   Expected Impact: +$800-1000 earnings (+43-53% increase)

2. ELIMINATE STAGNATION ⭐⭐⭐
   Current: 71.5% idle time
   Target: <40% idle time
   
   Action Plan:
   - Set 30-minute max wait before repositioning
   - Move to high-demand zones proactively
   - Never stay in same zone >2 hours without earnings
   - Avoid 2-7 AM entirely (zero earnings window)
   
   Expected Impact: +$400-600 earnings (+21-32% increase)

3. RATING PRESERVATION ⭐⭐
   Current: 4.70 → 4.43 (steady decline)
   Target: Maintain >4.5 throughout
   
   Action Plan:
   - Decline rides >20 minutes away (fuel waste + rating risk)
   - Prioritize short, high-value rides
   - Implement rating recovery: if <4.5, take only sure bets
   - Track which zones/times have lowest-rated passengers
   
   Expected Impact: Access to higher-value rides, +$200-300 earnings

4. TIME OPTIMIZATION ⭐⭐
   Current: Some activity during low-earning hours
   Target: Focus on 8-10 AM and 6-10 PM prime time
   
   Action Plan:
   - 6-10 PM: Maximum activity (prime earnings)
   - 8-10 AM: Morning rush focus
   - 10 AM-2 PM: Moderate activity in University/Downtown
   - 2-6 AM: Sleep/maintenance (zero earnings anyway)
   
   Expected Impact: +20-30% hourly rate improvement

5. FUEL EFFICIENCY ⭐
   Current: 13 refueling events, high consumption on repositioning
   Target: <10 refueling events, minimize empty repositioning
   
   Action Plan:
   - Accept rides that move toward target zones
   - Decline rides requiring long repositioning
   - Refuel opportunistically when in high-demand zones
   - Track fuel cost vs ride earnings
   
   Expected Impact: +$100-150 savings

================================================================================
12. CONCLUSION
================================================================================

STRENGTHS:
✅ Strong learning capability (189% improvement)
✅ Identified profitable time windows (evening hours)
✅ Improved ride frequency over time
✅ Sustained high performance after Day 8

WEAKNESSES:
⚠️  Poor zone allocation (65% time in worst zones)
⚠️  Excessive stagnation (71% idle time)
⚠️  No rating recovery strategy
⚠️  Low utilization (28.5% productive hours)

OVERALL GRADE: C+ (Learning potential: A)

The agent shows strong adaptive learning but suffers from strategic
inefficiencies. With optimized zone selection and reduced stagnation,
earnings could nearly double. The 189% improvement curve suggests the
agent would continue improving with more training data.

Primary action: Reallocate time from Airport/Nightlife (180h @ $4/hr)
to Residential/University zones (4x more profitable).

This single change could add $800-1000 to earnings with no additional
effort - simply being in the right place at the right time.
